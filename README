* Tons of new config options! See examples/orodruin/... and
  examples/morannon/...

======================================================================

Warning: configuration changed a lot since release 3.9.7, so using an
old configuration without any changes for release 4 will cause
problems.

In particular, Roland's fgpack script (see doc/Fido-Point-HOWTO) does
*NOT* work with the release 4 ftnpack!!!
