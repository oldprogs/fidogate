This directory contains the sendmail m4 configuration files from the
RedHat 4.0 (Colgate) release with some additional config files for
FIDOGATE support.

See cf/*.mc for a sample setup with FIDOGATE.

README.ORIG	is the original README describing the m4 config in detail
cf.ORIG/	is the original cf/ subdirectory


If you only want to copy the FIDOGATE specific files to you own
sendmail m4 configuration tree, these are:

mailer/ftn.m4	FIDOGATE ftn mailer definitions (ftn, ftni, ftna, ftno)
mailer/ffx.m4	FIDOGATE ffx mailer definition
cf/*		various example config files, mailertables etc.
