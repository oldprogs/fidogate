This manual documents how to install and use FIDOGATE. It is the first
step toward a concise documentation. Alas, writing documentation is a
somewhat tedious business, so this manual is far from complete.

Introduction to FIDOGATE
************************

FIDOGATE is a gateway software between the worlds of FIDO
NetMail/EchoMail (or FTNs, Fido Technology Networks in general) and the
UNIX mail/news system. FIDOGATE will convert FIDO mail packets to
RFC822-style messages and vice versa.  It is placed under the GNU
General Public License, see file COPYING for details.

   This version of FIDOGATE also includes a complete passthru FIDO mail
processor (NetMail/EchoMail scanner and tosser) and an Areafix-like
utility.

How to Get FIDOGATE
===================

The latest version of FIDOGATE is available at the following sites.

Internet anonymous ftp:
     ftp.comnets.rwth-aachen.de  (137.226.4.111)
     /pub/mail+news/fidogate-x.y.tar.gz

BBS and FIDO frequest:
     2:2452/110 242:1000/1 +49-241-875090  (HST/V.32bis)
     2:2452/111 242:1000/2 +49-241-8790420 (ISDN V.110/X.75)
     File area #51, file name fgatexy.tgz

Requirements for FIDOGATE:
==========================

   * Something that gets you FIDONET mail. If you want a FIDO mailer, I
     recommend using ifcico from Eugene Crosser's ifmail package.

   * Installed news system. (CNews or INN)

   * A new reader. (nn, tin, Emacs GNUS)

   * A mail transport agent. (sendmail or smail)

   * A mail user agent. (mail, elm, pine, Emacs)

FIDOGATE Mailing List
=====================

There is a mailing list for FIDOGATE discussions and announcements:
     fgate-users@gondor.gun.de

   For subscription send mail to
     fgate-users-request@gondor.gun.de

Credits
=======

   This stuff is a derived version of a posting called `rfmail' to
Usenet's alt.sources some time ago. I rewrote the entire code by now.

   The original `rfmail' authors were: Teemu Torma, who wrote the first
version, and Heikki Suonsivu, who did some changes and improvements and
posted version 0.3.3 to the net.

   Also used:

The parsedate.y date/time parser, from INN 1.4:
     Originally written by Steven M. Bellovin <smb@research.att.com> while
     at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Later tweaked by
     a couple of people on Usenet.  Completely overhauled by Rich $alz
     <rsalz@osf.org> and Jim Berets <jberets@bbn.com> in August, 1990.
     Further revised (removed obsolete constructs and cleaned up timezone
     names) in August, 1991, by Rich.  Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com>
     helped in September, 1992.
   (Changed slightly and adopted for FIDOGATE)

The xstrtok() function:
     16/10/1991      Wolfram Roesler         wr@bara.oche.de

GNU `getopt'.

The wildmat() function from GNU tar, modified and adopted for FIDOGATE.


Compiling and installing FIDOGATE
*********************************


* Point::       Installing a FIDOGATE point system
* config.h::    The `config.h' header file
* config.make:: The `config.make' Makefile configuration
* Compiling::   Compiling and installing FIDOGATE
* Integration:: Integrating FIDOGATE and the mail/news system
* Testing::     Testing FIDOGATE operation
* Connecting::  Connecting to FIDONET

This chapter describes the FIDOGATE program configuration and
installation.  You must also edit the config files to be installed in
the LIBDIR directory. Change `config.common', `config.gate',
`config.main', `config.ffx', `areas', `hosts', `passwd', `routing',
`packing', `aliases', `maus' according to your setup (examples from my
configuration contained in the lib subdirectory).

   The chapter on config files describes them in detail.


Installing a FIDGATE Point System
=================================

Hints for setting up a FIDOGATE point system without Internet mail
connectivity:

   * Choose a host name and a domain name. Since both won't be visible
     to the outside world, you may choose whatever you want.

   * Put the `NoFromLine' keyword into `config'!!!

   * Comment out `PASSTHRU_NETMAIL' and `PASSTHRU_ECHOMAIL' in
     `src/config.h'. These functions are not necessary for a point
     system and may cause trouble.

   * If you want to send Internet mail via a FIDO-Internet gateway, set
     it's address with `Gateway' in `config.gate'. FIDOGATE can then be
     used as your default mailer, delivering all non-FIDO mail to this
     gateway.

   Sample `lib/config.gate' settings for a point:

     hostname  mordor
     domain    .middle.earth
     address   2:2499/666.42
     uplink    2:2499/666
     nofromeline
     gateway   2:2476/2

   See also `doc/FidoPnt.txt' for a complete description (German!) on
how to install a point system on LINUX using FIDOGATE, ifcico, CNews,
and smail.

   If you have trouble with the `smail' installation (which seems to be
overly complicated for such a simple task), you may try `sendmail'
8.6.x (there is a simple to install LINUX binary available) and the
config files in the config/sendmail/v8/cf directory. This sendmail
version is the default MTA in the Slackware 2.1 distribution, too.


The `src/config.h' Header File
==============================

Comment/uncomment/change the `#define's to suit your requirements.

Common configuration:

`HOSTS_RESTRICTED'
     Restrict the usage of the gateway to nodes registered in the
     `hosts' config file, e.g. only these node may send/receive mail
     to/from the Internet.

`LOCAL_FTN_ADDRESSES'
     Generate "local" FTN addresses: User_Name%p.f.n.z@hostname.domain
     instead of User_name@p.f.n.z.domain.

`DO_BSY_FILES'
     Create Binkley-style busy files while accessing the Binkley
     outbound.

`SECURE'
     Enable secure permissions for packet and data files.

`MAXMSGSIZE'
     Maximum size of FIDO messages generated by `rfc2ftn', larger
     messages will be split. Alas, less than 16K seems to be the only
     safe setting. This is the default value.

`FTN_INVALID_DOMAIN'
     Domain address to be used for invalid FTN addresses.

`ftn2rfc' configuration:

`FTN_JUNK'
     Specifies a default newsgroup for unknown (i.e. no entry in
     `areas') FTN areas.

`ERRORS_TO'
     Write `Errors-To' header to RFC message, causing error messages
     sent to the specified address, if the MTA supports this (`sendmail'
     does).

`ADD_DOMAIN'
     Add hostname.domain to local addresses, e.g. `To: mj' will be
     converted to `To: mj@sungate.fido.de'.

`ALIASES_ARE_LOCAL'
     Addresses found in the `aliases' config file are rewritten so that
     the sender's address is the gateway.

`CHARSET_DEFAULT_IBMPC'
     Make IBMPC the default char set (no `^ACHRS' kludge).

`rfc2ftn' configuration:

`PASSTHRU_NETMAIL'
     Passthru operation for NetMail: if the sender of the message is an
     FTN address, the origin address of the resulting FTN message will
     be that FTN address.

`PASSTHRU_ECHOMAIL'
     Passthru operation for EchoMail: if the sender of the message is
     an FTN address, this address will be put into the origin line of
     the resulting FTN message. If the RFC message contains an
     `X-FTN-Origin' header, this one will be used for the origin line.
     NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

`FTN_4D_ECHOMAIL_WITH_POINTS'
     Generate EchoMail control lines with point addresses, e.g.
          SEEN-BY: 2452/110.1
          ^APATH: 2452/110.1
     If commented, the point address is left out. This only applies to a
     point setup with 4D EchoMail. Leaving this commented seems to be
     the best setting.

`FSC_0035'
     Generate `^AREPLYADDR', `^AREPLYTO' kludges according to FSC-0035.

`FSC_0047'
     Generate `^ASPLIT' kludge according to FSC-0047 for split messages.

`FTN_FORCE_INTL'
     Always generate a `^AINTL' kludge, even if sender and receiver are
     in the same default zone (first `Address' in `config').

`NO_CONTROL'
     Do not pass news control messages (newgroup, cancel, etc.) to the
     FTN side of the gateway.

System dependent configuration:

`DO_HAVE_GETTIMEOFDAY'
     Define, if the system has the gettimeofday() function.

`DO_HAVE_TM_GMTOFF'
     Define, if the system has a tm_gmtoff field in struct tm.

`DO_HAVE_TM_ZONE'
     Define, if the system has a tm_zone field in struct tm.

`DO_HAVE_STRFTIME'
     Define, if the system has the Standard-C strftime() function.

`DO_HAVE_TZNAME'
     Define, if the system has `extern char *tzname[2]'.

`DO_HAVE_STRCASECMP'
     Define, if the system has the `strcasecmp()' and `strncasecmp()'
     functions.

`DO_HAVE_STRICMP'
     Define, if the system has the `stricmp()' and `strnicmp()'
     functions.

`DO_BINARY'
     Define, if files must be opened in binary mode.

   Define only one of `DO_HAVE_TM_ZONE', `DO_HAVE_STRFTIME',
`DO_HAVE_TZNAME', and also only one of `DO_HAVE_STRCASECMP',
`DO_HAVE_STRICMP'.

   The following systems are recognized automatically: SunOS 4.1.x,
LINUX, Interactive UNIX, MSDOS with DJGPP gcc, OS/2 with EMX gcc.

THE FOLLOWING DEFINES SHOULD NORMALLY LEFT AS IS!!!

Message ID configuration:

`FIDODOMAIN'
     Default Internet domain for standard FIDO addresses (zone 1-6).
     Used for Message-IDs only, so DO NOT CHANGE.

`MSGID_ORIGID'
     Generate Gatebau '93 `^AORIGID', `^AORIGREF' kludges.

`MSGID_NEW_MSGID'
     Generate FTN MSGIDs according to the FIDO Gatebau '94
     recommendation (see doc/msgid.doc).

`LIB'
     Name of the FIDOGATE library.

   If the directories in `SPOOLDIR' are different from the default ones
in `config.h', the commands for the `install-dirs' target of
`src/Makefile' must be changed as well.


Compiling and Installing FIDOGATE
=================================

After editing `config.h' and `config.make', `cd' to the `src'
directory, and have a look at `ftninpost.pl'. Most likely the variables
`$RELAY' (name of the FIDO side of the gateway), `$SENDMAIL' (MTA
command for mail), and `$RNEWS' (command for news) will need some
editing.

   You may also want to uncomment the line running the `ftninrecomb'
command in `ftninpost.pl' to enabled the recombining of split FIDO
messages to a single mail/posting.

   Then compile the beast by entering
     make

   Alternatively an optimized version can be compiled with
     make DEBUG=-O2

   If everything works, you must create the necessary directories:
     make install-dirs
   Then install all FIDOGATE programs:
     make install

   Next change to the lib directory. After editing the various config
files or creating them for scratch, install them:
     make install

   The `passwd' config file must be installed manually.


Integrating FIDOGATE and the Mail/News System
=============================================

See the `config' directory for hints and config files for CNews, INN,
and sendmail. More documentation is included in the `doc' directory,
especially the `FIDOGATE-Point-HOWTO'. Most of it is written in German,
though.

`config/cnews'
     Configuration examples for CNews.

`config/ftnaf'
     Configuration examples for `ftnaf': MTA aliases, `areas.bbs'.

`config/inn'
     Configuration examples for INN.

`config/sendmail/v8'
     sendmail V8 configuration files (m4) and examples .mc files for
     FIDOGATE: Fido.DE domain gateway setup, point setup.

   Much more concise instructions should be here!!! ;-)


Testing FIDOGATE Operation
==========================

`ftn2rfc'
---------

To verify proper operation of FIDOGATE, copy a FIDO mail packet to the
directory SPOOLDIR/in, then execute LIBDIR/ftn2rfc as user `OWNER'. Add
some `-v' options for verbose debug messages:
     libdir/ftn2rfc -vvvvv

   This should result in one or more files named `nnnnnnnn.msg' in the
directories SPOOLDIR/in/mail and SPOOLDIR/in/news. Check these files and
verify that they at least look like RFC headers. ;-)

   Next execute
     libdir/ftninpost
   this will feed those files to `rnews' and `sendmail'. After some
processing you should find the messages in your mail folder and/or
newsgroups.

`rfc2ftn'
---------

Grab a single news posting in a FIDO linked newsgroup and feed it to
`rfc2ftn':
     libdir/rfc2ftn -vvvvv -n <ARTICLE
   This should result in a FIDO mail packet `nnnnnnnn.pkt' in the
directory SPOOLDIR/out.

   Do the same with a mail message addressed to a FIDO recipient:
     libdir/rfc2ftn -vvvvv USER_NAME@FIDO.ADDRESS <MESSAGE
   Again you should get a packet `nnnnnnnn.pkt' in SPOOLDIR/out.

   If this is working and you have integrated FIDOGATE and mail/news,
you can try posting an article to a FIDO linked newsgroups and/or
mailing a message to a recipient on FIDONET.  The resulting packets
should be in SPOOLDIR/out.


Connecting to FIDONET
=====================

FIDOGATE does NOT include a FIDO mailer, so you have to transfer FIDO
mail to and from the UNIX system by some other means.

   If you want everything running on the UNIX system, you need a FIDO
mailer for UNIX. To my knowledge there are two working FIDO mailers:
   * BinkleyTerm 3.02pl10

   * ifcico 2.x from Eugene Crosser's ifmail package

   The solution I'm using is a separate PC running DOS and BinkleyTerm
as a mailer. My system currently comprises a LINUX PC for the
gateway/tosser and NFS server, and 3 PCs running DOS. 2 of them are
running BinkleyTerm for the phone and ISDN lines. The BinkleyTerm
outbound is kept on the LINUX server, so all PCs and the gateway have
access to it.

     directory will be archived and transfered as a single `ffx'
     command.

`-B --binkley name'
     Set Binkley outbound directory.

`-F --flavor flavor'
     Set flavor of outbound FLO file: `Hold', `Normal', `Direct', or
     `Crash'.

`-g --grade grade'
     Set grade of control and data files to grade (single letter
     [a-z0-9]).

`-w --wait-bsy'
     Wait, if busy file for the node exists. Default: terminate, don't
     archive batched `ffx'-Jobs.

   The name of the archiving program (`zip') is hardcoded in the

     are read from. Default: INBOUND

`-t --insecure'
     Process ffx files without password. Default: ffx file must contain
     a password.

   `ffxqt' searches the input directory for control files and executes
the requested commands. Commands are executed by running
LIBDIR/ffxqt-dir/command, so every allowed command must reside as a
script or symbolic link there.

   Some program/paths are hard coded in the `ffxqt.c' code.


ffxrmail -- Script for Processing FFX `rmail' Commands
======================================================

Usage:

     ffxrun  [-v]

   Perl script to be called as `rmail' by `ffxqt'. This replaces

and to fields.

   If no packet is given on the command line, `ftn2ftn' looks for
packets addressed to the gateway addresses (A and B) in the Binkley
outbound. Both gateway addresses must be specified with the `-A' and
`-B' options.

   If a packet name is passed on the command line, `ftn2ftn' will gate
this to the other network A. The gateway address (sender of the mails
in network A) is set with `-A' option.

`config.*' Configuration Files
==============================

FIDOGATE uses different config files:

`config.common'
     Common settings.

`config.gate'
     The config file for the gateway related programs `ftn2rfc',
     `ftnin', `rfc2ftn'.

`config.main'
     The config file for the tosser related programs `ftn2ftn',
     `ftnaf', `ftnbounce', `ftnbsy', `ftnhatch,' `ftnlock', `ftnlog',
     `ftnpack', `ftnroute', `ftnseq', `ftntick', `ftntoss',
     `out-attach'.

`config.ffx'
     The config file for the ffx programs `ffx', `ffxbatch', `ffxqt'

   The format of these files is

     keyword [ arg ... ]

   Keywords and arguments may be quoted in `""', keywords are
case-insensitive.

General configuration statements:

`include file'
     Include another config file, may be nested.

`Address node [fakenode]'
     Your FTN address (Z:N/F.P) and optional fakenet address. The
     fakenet address is used for points and 3D EchoMail. There may be
     up to 32 `Address' statements (`MAXADDRESS' from `config.h').

`Uplink node'
     The FTN address of your uplink, must be in the same order as the
     corresponding `Address' statements. There may be up to 32 `Uplink'
     statements.

Common configuration:

`LibDir directory'
     The FIDOGATE lib directory (default specified in `config.make').

`SpoolDir directory'
     The FIDOGATE spool directory (default specified in `config.make').

`LogDir directory'
     The FIDOGATE log file directory (default specified in
     `config.make').

`Outbound directory'
     The BinkleyTerm-style outbound base directory, without the
     `out.'nnn zone directory.

`Inbound directory'
     The BinkleyTerm-style inbound directory. (Currently the protected
     inbound, will be replaced by `PInbound'.)

`PInbound directory'
     The BinkleyTerm-style protected inbound directory. NOT YET
     IMPLEMENTED.

`Hostname name'
     The host name part of your Internet address.

`Domain name'

     specified (`MAXADDRESS' from `config.h').

`DosDrive drive directory'
     OPTIONAL: specify translation of a DOS drive (e.g. `H:') to a
     directory. This is useful, if you keep your outbound on a UNIX
     server and run BinkleyTerm on a DOS client. If one or more
     `DosDrive' statements are specified, FIDOGATE will automatically
     translate file attaches to the file names seen by the DOS client.
     Up to 16 `DosDrive' entries may be specified (`MAXDOSDRIVE' from
     `config.h').

Gateway configuration:

`Origin text'

     Specifies an FTN-Internet gateway for routing Internet mail to. If
     enabled, FIDOGATE can be used as the default delivery agent for all
     Internet mail.

`DotNames'
     Generate User.Name@host.do.main instead of User_Name@host.do.main.
     `rfc2ftn' recognizes both address types.

`X-FTN header'
     Include the various X-FTN header in the output of `ftn2rfc':
    `f'
          `X-FTN-From'

    `t'
          `X-FTN-To'

    `T'
          `X-FTN-Tearline'

    `O'
          `X-FTN-Origin'

    `V'
          `X-FTN-Via'

    `D'
          `X-FTN-Domain'

    `S'
          `X-FTN-Seen-By'

    `P'
          `X-FTN-Path'         `X-FTN-From' is required for the proper
     operation of `ftnaf'.

`MaxMsgSize bytes'
     Maximum size of FTN messages (default value).

`MausDomain .do.main'
`MausGate address'
     Enables and sets the processing of addresses for the German MAUS
     network, replacing the old `maus' config file. `MausDomain' sets
     the Internet domain of MAUS addresses, `MausGate' the address of
     the Fido-MAUS gateway.

     If set, User_Name@xy.maus.domain will be converted to User Name %
     XY for the Fido-MAUS gateway.

`BounceCCMail user@do.main'
     Send CC of bounced messages to this address.

`TrackerMail user@do.main'
     Forward mail from message trackers to this address.

Main AKA node configuration:

`AreasBBS name'
     Specifies the `areas.bbs' EchoMail distribution file used by
     `ftnaf' and `ftntoss'.

`FAreasBBS name'
     Specifies the `fareas.bbs' file echo distribution file used by
     `ftnaf -F' and `ftnhatch'/ `ftntick'. NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

`CCMail user@do.main'
     Send CC of `ftnaf''s replies to this address.

     Kill routed EchoMail messages (not addressed to one of our AKAs).
     CURRENTLY ALWAYS DONE.

`LogNetMail'
`Track'
     Log all NetMail messages in log file.

`ZoneGate node seenby'
     Zone gate operation: strip SEEN-BYs for EchoMail addressed to node
     and replace with listed seenby nodes. seenby must include both the
     link's and our address. Example:

          ZoneGate  1:105/42  105/42 2452/110

`AddToSeenBy area nodes'
     Add the listed nodes to the SEEN-BYs for EchoMail tossed in area.
     area may be specified using shell-style wildcards `*?[a-z]'.

ffx configuration:

   Nothing special yet.


`hosts' FTN Address to Host Name Conversion
===========================================

This file contains the FTN addresses and host names for registered FTN
nodes. If `HOSTS_RESTRICTED' is defined in `config.h', this file
controls the access to the gateway.

The format of this file is

     node  hostname  [ options ]

Fields:

node
     FTN address. An address for a node will match all points of this
     node, see example below.

hostname
     Host name, one of

    local host name
          A name without a trailing `.' is a hostname in the local
          domain (specified by `HostsDomain' or default `Domain' in
          `config').

    fully qualified domain name
          A name with a trailing `.' is a fully qualified domain name
          for this node.

    `-'
          A `-' specifies a listed node, but without a host name
          translation, using the standard p.f.n.z address.

options
    `-p'
          Generate addresses with point, e.g. `p99.hippo.fido.de'.
          Default is omitting the point.

    `-d'
          Mark the node as down, mail to this address will be bounced
          with an appropiate error message.

   The `hosts' file is read into memory during startup of FIDOGATE.
The first entry found matches, so a host name for a point must be
specified before the boss node, if there are entries for both.

   Example:

`config':

     HostsDomain   .Fido.DE

`hosts':

     2:2452/110    hippo
     2:2452/990    test     -p
     2:2452/991    test.wusel.org.
     2:2452/999    -

Resulting data base read into memory:

     Node:     2:2452/110.0
     Hostname: hippo.Fido.DE
     Flags:
     
     Node:     2:2452/990.0
     Hostname: test.Fido.DE
     Flags:    POINT
     
     Node:     2:2452/991.0
     Hostname: test.wusel.org
     Flags:
     
     Node:     2:2452/999.0
     Hostname:
     Flags:

This results in the following conversion of addresses from FTN to
Internet:

     2:2452/110     ->  hippo.Fido.DE
     2:2452/110.99  ->  hippo.Fido.DE
     2:2452/990.99  ->  p99.test.Fido.DE
     2:2452/991.1   ->  test.wusel.org
     2:2452/999.2   ->  p2.f999.n2452.z2.Fido.DE


`aliases' User Aliases
======================

This file contains user aliases, the FTN address, and the full name of
the user.

The format of this file is

     alias  node  "full name"

Fields:

alias
     Alias for the user.

node
     FTN address of the user.

full name
     Full name of the user.

   The FTN address node may be a point address. In this case mail
addressed to the user at the boss node address will be readdressed to
this point, see example below.

   Example:

`aliases':

     mvr         2:2452/110.6    "Marc van.Rey"

   Using the definitions from the section on `hosts', this results in
the following address conversion:

     Marc van.Rey @ 2:2452/110.6  <->  mvr@hippo.Fido.DE


`areas' FTN Area to Newsgroup Conversion
========================================

This file contains FTN areas with corresponding newsgroups and options.

The format of this file is

     area  newsgroup  [ options ]

Fields:

area
     FTN area.

newsgroup
     Usenet newsgroup.

options
     IMPORTANT: there must be spaces between the option and its
     arguments!

    `-a address'
          Select alternate FTN address for this area/newsgroup. NOT YET
          IMPLEMENTED.

    `-z zone'
          Select zone AKA zone for this area/newsgroup.

    `-d distribution'
          Use Usenet `distribution' for this newsgroup when gating from
          FTN to Internet.

    `-o "origin"'
          Use an alternate origin line for this area when gating from
          Internet to FTN.  (Default specified in `config'.)

    `-g'
          Don't send messages from another SomeNet-FTN gateway across
          the gateway.

    `-l'
          Only local crosspostings are allowed in this newsgroup/area.

    `-x'
          No crosspostings are allowed in this newsgroup/area.

    `-8'
          Use the ISO-8859-1 charset when gating to this newsgroup. NOT
          YET IMPLEMENTED.

    `-H'
          Area/newsgroup matches entire hierarchy. Names are converted
          automatically, using upper case for area names and lower case
          for newsgroups. `_' in area names is converted to `-' in
          newsgroup names, and vice versa.

          Example:
               GNU.    gnu.    -z 242  -H
          `gnu.announce' will be converted to `GNU.ANNOUNCE',
          `gnu.bug.gcc' to `GNU.BUG.GCC', similar for all other.

    `-!'
          Don't gate this area/newsgroup or hierarchy (if combined with
          `-H'). Usefull to exclude certain newsgroups from a hierarchy
          for gating.

          Example:
               ALT.BINARIES.    alt.binaries.    -z 242  -H -!
               ALT.             alt.             -z 242  -H
          This is roughly equivalent to INN's `alt.*,!alt.binaries.*'.
          Please note that the first `areas' entry matches, so any `-!'
          must be placed before the `-H' hierarchy definition.

    `-R level'
          Select level of `^ARFC-'Header put into FIDO messages for this
          area. Level:
         0
               No `^ARFC-'header at all.

         1
               Only important `^ARFC-'header.

         2
               All `^ARFC-'header.          NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

    `-m bytes'
          Sets `MaxMsgSize' for this area (0 = no limit).

    `-X "RFC-Header: text"'
          Add extra RFC header to output of `ftn2rfc'. Multiple `-X'
          options are possible.

   Only newsgroups listed in this file will be gated from Internet to
FTN.  FTN area not listed in this file will be gated into the `FTN_JUNK'
newsgroup specified in `config.h'.


Bounce Messages of `ftn2rfc'
============================

`ftn2rfc' uses the following files for messages sent to the FTN user
when bouncing mail for some reason:

`bounce.noto'
     Message addressed to user `UUCP' or `GATEWAY' without a `To' line
     at the very beginning of the message.

`bounce.down'
     Message addressed from/to node currently marked as down in `hosts'
     (`-d' flag).

`bounce.restricted'
     Messages from nodes not listed in `hosts', gateway running in
     restricted mode.

`bounce.insecure'
     Messages came via an insecure (i.e. not password protected) link
     and contain a `To' line. This requires the `-t' option to
     `ftn2rfc'.

   Within a bounce message, the following substitutions can be used:

`%F'
     FTN address of message sender.

`%T'
     FTN address of message recipient (the gateway, that is).

`%O'
     FTN address of message origin.

`%d'
     Date/time of message.

`%t'
     Name of message recipient.

`%f'
     Name of message sender.

`%s'
     Message subject.

`%R'
     `To' line, Internet address.

`%M'
     The entire message body.


`passwd' Password Config File
=============================

This file contains passwords used by `ftnaf', `ffx', and the tosser
programs.

The format of this file is:

     context  node  password  options

Contexts:

`packet'
     FTN packet passwords, checked by `ftntoss', inserted by all
     FIDOGATE programs which create FTN packets. Password checking for
     incoming packets is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

`af'
     Areafix passwords for requests to `ftnaf'.

`ff'
     Filefix passwords for requests to `ftnaf -F'.

`ffx'
     `ffx' command passwords, checked by `ffxqt', inserted by `ffx'
     into the `.ffx' command files.

   Optional stuff (options) is used for `ftnaf' permission settings:

     lvl  key  "Sysop Name"

   lvl is the access level, which must be greater or equal than the one
in `areas.bbs'. key is the access key, which must be a super set of the
one in `areas.bbs'.

   Example:

     packet      2:1234/5678     WUERG
     ffx         242:1111/99     BLAHBLUB
     af          2:1234/5678     WUSEL       1   F     "Test Sysop"
     ff          242:1234/5678   WUSEL       4   UQ    "Yet Another Sysop"


`routing' Config File
=====================

This file contains the routing commands performed by `ftntoss'
(commands `remap' and `rewrite') and `ftnroute' (everything else). The
first routing command found matches.

   The syntax of the `routing' commands is very similar to the routing
file used by the well-known FIDO tossers QMail and SQUISH.

The format of this file is:

     remap      src-node  dest-node  name
     rewrite    src-node  dest-node
     
     echomail
     netmail
     
     send       flavor    nodes
     route      flavor    dest-node nodes
     hostroute  flavor    nodes
     hubroute   flavor    nodes
     
     change     old-flavor  new-flavor  nodes
     
     sendmove   flavor    nodes

Commands:

`remap'
     Remaps NetMail addressed to name at src-node to the new address
     dest-node. Most usefull for remapping to points based on their
     name.  name supports shell-style wildcard patterns.

`rewrite'
     Rewrites NetMail from and to addresses. A node address matching
     src-node will be changed to dest-node.

`echomail'
     Starts routing commands for EchoMail.

`netmail'
     Starts routing commands for NetMail.

`allmail'
     Starts routing commands for both EchoMail and NetMail. NOT YET
     IMPLEMENTED.

`send'
     Send normal mail addressed to nodes with flavor.

     WARNING: there is a bug in the current implementation of `send'
     (when compared to the operation of e.g. SQUISH). A command `send
     hold 2:123/456' actually equals `send hold 2:123/456.*', i.e. mail
     for every single point of this node is put onto hold. Use the
     command `route hold 2:123/456' instead to get the desired
     behaviour!!!

`route'
     Route normal mail addressed to nodes via dest-node, using flavor.

`hostroute'
     Route normal mail addressed to nodes via their host (i.e. Z:N/0),
     using flavor.

`hubroute'
     Route normal mail addressed to nodes via their hub, using flavor.
     NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

`change'
     Change flavor of mail packet from old-flavor to new-flavor.

`sendmove'
     Like `send', but `ftnroute' doesn't copy the mail packets, they
     are moved instead. This requires that SPOOLDIR/toss/tmp and
     SPOOLDIR/toss/out are on the same file system/disk drive.

   Node addresses nodes, src-node, dest-node support wildcards using
`*' and `all', which can be used for the zone, net, node, and point
component of an address. `*' alone matches all addresses. `rewrite'
wildcards in the destination address are replaced with the
corresponding component of the source address.

The outbound flavor string flavor can be any of `normal', `hold',
`crash', `direct', `out', `hut', `cut', `dut'.

   Example:

     Remap     2:2452/110.0 2:2452/110.7  "Martin Koser"
     Rewrite   242:241/*    2:241/*
     
     NetMail
     send      hold         242:1000/1.all
     change    crash  hold  242:1000/1.all 2.all
     send      hold         242:1000/3
     route     hold         242:1000/50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59


`packing' Config File
=====================

This file contains the packer (archiver) definitions and packing
commands for `ftnpack'.

The format of this file is:

     arc        name  `"'archiver`"'
     prog       name  `"'program`"'
     
     pack       name  nodes
     rpack      name  dest-node  nodes
     fpack      name  dest-node  nodes

Packer/program definitions:

`arc'
     Defines the archiver name as program archiver. The archiver string
     must contain two `%s', the first one is replaced with the archive
     name, the second one with the packet name.

`prog'
     Defines the program name as program. The program string must
     contain a `%s', which is replaced with the name of the packet to be
     processed.

Packing definitions:

`pack'
     Pack all mail addressed to nodes using the archiver defined as
     name. The archiver name `noarc' indicates that the mail packet
     should not be packed, but copied to the OUT file of the node.

`rpack'
     Same as `pack', but pack all mail addressed to nodes to the
     archive for dest-node.

`fpack'
     Similar to `rpack', but the packet is archived for the normal
     arcmail packet for each node. This archive is then attached to the
     FLO file of dest-node.

   Example:

     arc     zip     "/usr/local/bin/zip -gkj %s %s"
     
     rpack   zip     2:242/41 2:242/42 242:2000/* 254:*/*
     pack    noarc   2:2452/110.1 242:4900/99 254:2410/6.1
     pack    zip     *


`areas.bbs' EchoMail Distribution
=================================

This file contains the EchoMail areas and linked nodes. The file
`fareas.bbs' is used for file echos.

   The format of this file is as follows, the first line being ignored
for compatibility with the standard DOS AREAS.BBS.

     directory  area  [options]  nodes

directory
     The directory where the message base/file base for this area is
     located.  Currently FIDOGATE uses the directory for file areas
     only.

area
     The area name.

options
     Options for this area:
    `-a address'
          Set alternate FTN AKA for this area. NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

    `-z zone'
          Set alternate zone AKA for this area. NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
          (zone taken from first node in nodes list).

    `-l lvl'
          Set Areafix/Filefix access level for this area.

    `-k key'
          Set Areafix/Filefix access key for this area.

nodes
     The list of downlink nodes. This is a sorted short list of nodes
     as in FIDO EchoMail SEEN-BYs and PATH. The first node in nodes
     stays at this place, though.

   Do not put your own address into `areas.bbs'. FIDOGATE will select
the AKA corresponding to the zone of the first node listed in nodes.


Basic Configuration
*******************

   There seems to be some confusion about how to configure the gateway
and the tosser, so a added this chapter. Hopefully this will help ...

   The following applies to a simple Fido node setup with one uplink,
several points and the gateway.

   Most important, the gateway and the node (main aka) need different
addresses!!! The gateway is some sort of a "sysop point", so normally
you must assign one of your point addresses to the gateway. The
`Uplink' in `config.gate' is your node address.


* Example::       Example leaf node configuration


Example Leaf Node configuration
===============================

Let's assume the following addresses:

   Fido main address 2:2499/123

   Uplink (NetMail and EchoMail) 2:2499/100

   Local gateway address 2:2499/123.1

   Two points, Max Mueller @ 2:2499/123.10, Sabine Meier @ 2:2499/123.11

Address configuration `config.gate' (uplink is node address!):

     Address 2:2499/123.1
     Uplink  2:2499/123

Address configuration `config.main' (no uplink here!):

     Address 2:2499/123

Routing configuration `routing': NetMail for the two points will be
remapped to their point addresses, everything else to the gateway (where
you will be reading your mail). NetMail for all points is `send' onto
hold, everything else `route'd to your uplink. EchoMail is alway put
onto hold.

     remap 2:2499/123.0 2:2499/123.10 "Max Mueller"
     remap 2:2499/123.0 2:2499/123.11 "Sabine Meier"
     remap 2:2499/123.0 2:2499/123.1  "*"
     
     NetMail
     send  hold 2:2499/123.*
     route hold 2:2499/100 1:* 2:* 3:* 4:* 5:* 6:*
     
     EchoMail
     sendmove hold *

Packer configuration `packing': no packing for the gateway address,
`zip' is the default archiver for everything else.

     arc zip "/usr/local/bin/zip -gkjq %s %s"
     
     pack noarch 2:2499/123.1
     pack zip    *

Next, the EchoMail areas must be listed in the `areas.bbs' file. Do not
put your node address into `areas.bbs'! Example with two areas, both
subscribed by the gateway and your points (the directory `X' is not
used for EchoMail areas):

     Your system name!sysop name
     X LINUX.GER 2:2499/100 123.1 .10 .11
     X UNIX.GER  2:2499/100 123.1 .11

   In the gateway configuration, these areas must be listed in the
`areas' config file:

     LINUX.GER fido.ger.linux
     UNIX.GER  fido.ger.unix

   Now the gateway is able to process EchoMail. The program `ftnin'
should be run to gate any (unpacked) FTN outbound mail packet for
2:2499/123.1. The scripts `runin' and `runout' run the tosser for
processing the inbound and the gateway output, respectively.

   To use the `ftnaf' areafix, the gateway and the mail system must be
working. You can then install suitable aliases in `/etc/aliases':

     # Areafix/Filefix - FIDOGATE ftnaf
     areafix: "|/usr/local/lib/fidonet/ftnaf -m", admin
     areamgr: areafix
     filefix: "|/usr/local/lib/fidonet/ftnaf -F -m", admin
     filemgr: filefix

   That's it. Hope that this short chapter on basic configuration
clarifies some of the darker point of the FIDOGATE configuration.
Anyway, please help to improve the FIDOGATE documentation.
