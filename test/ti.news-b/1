	I was told by Louis Eggebrecht in December that there were plans to
allow Windows NT to run on the Amiga. He mentioned RISC chips and the
DEC ALPHA. He also said that the Power PC would not be used, although
they were looking for something that could handle multiple operating
systems.

	He also mentioned that CBM would use more mainstream technology,
and that the high end chip set would probably be expensive compared to
an a4000.

RE: the solar keyboard calculator.


Hahahahahohohchortleguffawetc.  If you need a solar calculator you can get
them quite cheaply, but if you just need this "It lets users perform a variety
of calculation funcions without interrupting the program currently running on
the computer" just use the calculator program that came with your Amiga.  The
Amiga multitasks, remember?  While on the Mac, if you switched to a calculator
program your other programs might very well drop everything and wait.

For me, since I needed a memory calculator, I wrote my own in CanDo.  Didn't
take long to do.

Later,
 -Jamie

PS.  But if you have another reason for buying a Mac, go for it, or get AMAX,
etc., but I can't see buying a Mac just to hook up a clunky piece of
unneccessary hardware to the keyboard...

I rented this tape about a year ago, thinking it was just another
run-of-the-mill horror flick and was blown away by its mixture of
ethereal images (the two girls in dark cloaks drifting through the
foggy countryside), eroticism and unrelenting horror sequences (the
epic scenes of bloodletting).  Peverse and bloody, the way a good
vampire flick should be.  :-)

I wound up watching it three times before I returned it.  Who
directed it and has the director or others in the team done more work
in the same vein?  (Oops.  No pun intended.)

Congratulations. :^)

Agreed. Actually, I think in many cases Amiga owners are the first to
admit that the Amiga is not perfect. In forums like this one,
however, there is some pressure to act like the machine is absolutely
perfect since any admission of a flaw would be seen as sign of
weakness. ;^)

That said, I do think some of your objections are a bit off (big
surprise,eh :^)

Philip> I will repeat my main objections to the Amiga: (1) Virtually
Philip> forced to use the 1960

This statement is simply ridiculous.

Philip> (2) No educational software 

I'll take your word on this... I personally consider a C compiler to
be an educational program, but then again I guess you were thinking
about a younger age group ;-).

Philip> (3) Expensive

I think it really depends on what kind of system you're buying... at
the high end of the price scale, you are pretty much correct, I'd
say. I don't think this is as bad at the mid-range and at the way
low-end the Amiga really wins big time.

Philip> (4) Mediocre sound

Uh oh... you're one of those "sound" people. If it doesn't have CD
quality sound its mediocre right? Sure if you have an application in
mind that would require 16bit sound, the built-in sound is weak, but
for most common computer applications the Amiga has *great* sound,
IMHO.

It sounds like you have some specific application in mind... what do
you want to do soundwise with a computer? It's quite possible that
the Amiga will not fit your needs if this is a hard requirement.

I *personally* don't want to pay for sound >Amiga's at this time.
(Because all I use it for is game and mod playing...)

Philip> and totally unacceptable built in speech with the older OS's 

Yeah right. Clearly, the Amiga's built in speech is totally eclipsed
by the built in speech on all of the other platforms. 

Jeez... It's almost like you're complaining just because it's there.
It was nifty in 85 and was later retained for backwards
compatability, it adds maybe $1 to the total cost of the system.
If you actually have some kind of need for speech buy a sampler for
$50-80, this is the 90's for God's sake.

Philip> (5) Does not presume a hard drive.

That's true in a sense... lots of games, etc, still are floppy only
and it sucks.  On the bright side, I can't think of a single app that
won't HD install. Many of the newer ones basically require an HD.

Jerry> Oh, excuse me.  What *is* the Dalton's Dictionary definition of

Most automobile enthusiasts make (maybe I should say
*appreciate* instead of "make") many more distinctions between
different car categories than most "lay people" would.  Since a
computer advocacy group like this is *necessarily* composed of
"computer enthusiasts" who are willing to make this level of
distinction when discussing computer systems, I expect you and
anyone else making car analogies in this forum to take the time
necessary use that same level of accuracy of classification when
formulating your analogies.

Otherwise, they will be invalid at best or underscore the
poster's ignorance at worst (your case).

If your only criteria for calling a car a sports car are
something along the lines of: 1. Looks cool. 2. Lots of Horsepower.
(About the only two properties which the Mustang shares with a
sports car) It makes me wonder about your ability to distinguish
between the subtleties provided by the various computing
platforms discussed here, as well, since you are clearly
ignoring (or do not understand and are willing to speak from
ignorance) what it means to say a car is a sports car.

The beauty of it is, I never said that because it was muscle car
it was *bad*.  I was just pointing out that it's *not the same*
as a sports car. If you want to go in a straight line way fast a
muscle car is a far more cost effective solution than a Real
Sports Car (and many times better, check out some of those old
GTO's yow).

Jerry> [Gagging] Oh please!  "The beauty of the Amiga" -- what a joke!
Jerry> Wait a minute, this *is* a joke, right?

By saying this, you're just proving my point.

I think everyone who understands computer systems on a technical
level and can perceive elegance in an engineering solution would
consider the Amiga computer to be one of the most aesthetically
appealing (in the technical sense) small systems available
today, given sufficient details of the system.

And, NO, that does not make it the right choice for every
application. Just like a sports car is not the right car for
every persons' automotive application. I don't expect my friend
with a wife and 3 kids to use or drive his car the same way I
(single no kids) do... That's one of the reasons he has a
mini-van and I don't. I'm willing (and able to due to my living
situation) to put up with some of the hassles and limitations of
owning a sports car in a trade off for some of the unique
capabilities it provides. That's pretty much the exact same
reason I own an Amiga, too.

By [Gagging] and trying to completely blow-off this point, you
simply confirm as you've done so many times in the past that
you're one of the people who would rather ignore this subtlety
of distinction and try to convince the entire world that your
choice is the right choice for everyone. This ludicrous position
is my main beef with you and the other clone advocates.

IMHO, the first step we must take when advocating the Amiga
should be to help others understand the elegance and power of
the Amiga system's design and how large an impact it can truly
have on the machine's use and performance.

If we can just achieve this, we'll have taken a large step
toward achieving the respect this computing platform deserves.

NextStep 486 uses some 486 specific operations. The 386 does seem
pretty complete - and incidently, it does "get rid of those ("naughty")
segments but keep compatibility with the old software". if you put the
processor in 386 protected mode, all memory is directly addressable
from one segment. however, for protection purposes of different
processes, segments are still sometimes used, and 8086 software would
not run very well if there weren't any segments!

PicTeX manual is not free.  TUG is authorized by the writer of PicTeX to

Don't you guys try to print it from your .dvi file at hand.  If you happen
to get one copy of it, please remove it right away.

        If your local newspaper regularly published Magnum stock
        photos without paying the royalties, would federal marshalls
        come in and seize their printing presses and word processors?

        I think the analogy is dead-on.

Yes, it is still being made. Seems to cost around $10 in quantities of
ten and is available in either DIP or PLCC packages. It was (and still
is?) popular in spacecraft applications, because it's very insensitive
to radiation. I believe this was because the die has a large feature
size and the substrate was made of some unusual material (sapphire?).
I think it's also fully static and so can be clocked down to 0 Hz for
negligible power consumption.

     Well, I tried it, and I've now got a working "big perl" (V4pl36)
that runs in a Windows 3.1 DOS box.  It even passes the tests that do
not depend upon unsupported features or "unix-isms" that aren't present
with messydos (with the possible exception of one test, which I'm still
chasing down).

     Next on the list is to wedge in GNU dbm ....

Guyver is a live-action movie based upon a Manga of the same name.  The
source material is pretty slim, IMHO, but the movie is truly bad. 
Awe-inspiringly so; dumb dialogue and cheap FX.  Very stupid movie.

Hi,

I've heard there are some problems with the earlier
Versions of the Maxtor 7213A AT-Bus drive.

I have such a drive, the PCBA is 63A  HDA 30A UNIQUE 56A
and have some strange Problems with different results in
reading a file multiple times under linux.

Can anybody tell me which version numbers are affected and 
what can be done to fix this?

Is this also a problem under DOS? I didn't have any
problems under DOS yet.

Das ist Geschmacksfrage. Mein Aha-Erlebnis kam, nachdem ich das Buch
zu Ende gelesen hatte, und merkte, dass ich mich an die Vertauschung
der Rollen in der Handlung und vor allem in der Sprache vollkommen ge-
woehnt hatte. Das zeigt einem mal, wie willkuerlich Sprache sein kann.
Von daher fand ich das Buch eher nicht zu lang. Du hast natuerlich 
recht mit Deiner Meinung, dass der Spannungsbogen gegen Ende etwas zu
stark abfaellt. Sowas passiert aber vielen Autoren, und als Essay 
haette der Stoff nun wirklich nicht die Verbreitung gefunden, die er
verdient.

Von "The Handmaid's Tale" kenne ich den Inhalt nur grob, von den anderen
beiden garnicht. Wie waer's, Du versorgst uns mal mit einer (kurzen!)
Inhaltsangabe?
Soweit ich das sehe, ist die anti-emanzipatorische Welle (gegen Frauen
und sexuelle Minderheiten) in den USA (nur dort?) im Moment eher im
An- als im Abschwellen (sic!). Das voellig ueberfluessige Gezaenk um 
die Schwulen in der US-Armee ist da nur ein Beispiel. Fuer genuegend
Literaturstoff waere also gesorgt. B-(

According to one of Intel's architect managers, who I've done numereous
joint presentations with, the original 486SX chips were done using the
486DX masks with the floating point disabled.  When the 486SX became more
popular, they re-did the layout for the 486SX to remove the floating point
portion completely, thus reducing the size and increasing the yield.

Don't salamnders eat insects? They must contain a lot of debugging code then.

Hi,all:
    I have installed the OS2 2.1 beta it very good, but I
find some problems.First, when I switch between tasks
I will find some dots on my desktop.More over,when I run
two graphic program in background, I will find the screen
disordered.
    Second, I don't is there any tool program like Compress
of PcTools and SpeeDisk of NORTON which works in HPFS.

 Actually, there are at least -two- local artists who have both Amigas and
Macs, and have ImageFX.  At least one of them has ImageMaster also. Both
have
ADPro.  They still say there are things in PhotoShop that the Amiga
programs don't have.  On the other hand, the one with the 4000 has to have
-something- to say to justify having bought the Mac!! [he did get it a

backlogged still locally as regards availability.]

writes:

   Mr. VanDevender graciously provided us with battery usage numbers, but
   he omitted the weight of all those binary 1's.  (You know, the more 1's
   in memory, the heavier the calculator weighs...)  Perhaps Speed Merchant can
   follow-up with a report on the comparative weights of different brands of
   battery, and a recommendation on the optimum battery to use for
   longest life, fullest RAM and lightest 48SX.  Now *there's* an engineering
   problem for you!

Actually, Speed Merchant Labs has been concentrating on another
research project of possibly staggering implications.

Some may have thought that one line of the published results on
battery life was in error.  It said that HP 48s whose memory had
been filled completely with binary 1s had an average battery life
of 0.25 years with a variance of 0.83 years, which is an order of
10 greater than the variance under other conditions, and which
would also imply that in some cases the batteries ran out several
months before they were installed.

We, of course, didn't believe these figures when the researcher
assigned to that part of the investigation presented them.  She,
however, had simply adhered to the measurement standards we had
set up for the experiment, and measured the time between battery
installation and appearance of a low-battery condition for
calculators given simulated normal daily use.  A few convincing
demonstrations by her showed that her results were not in error.

Her demonstrations were stunning.  After filling a calculator's
memory with all 1s, the calculator disappeared in a blue flash.
She did this with several calculators, then we proceeded to
search our building and grounds, and located about half of them,
many of which had appeared to have been lying around for months.
Several months later, one at a time, the other calculators were
recovered, in the same condition they had been in after leaving
her office.

Although we were reluctant to believe such an extraordinary
hypothesis, examining the affected calculators and their clocks
led us to an inescapable conclusion: filling HP 48 calculator
memory with all binary 1s causes the calculator to travel in
time.  Once Speed Merchant Labs has been able to calibrate and
quantify this effect, we expect that software exploiting it will
provide the HP 48 community with applications far more useful
than remote controls or tricorders.

Our only theory as to why this effect occurs is that a
combination of the high bit densities of modern memories,
combined with the small size of the HP 48, allows the formation
of a spacetime singularity which is capable of transporting the
HP 48 through space and time.  This effect does not happen with
larger devices because of their greater mass, although one of our
theoretical physicists is claiming that the effect will start to
appear in laptops when they begin using 16M-bit memory chips.

cvs kennt keinen  checkin-Befehl wie rcs. Neue Sourcen werden mit cvs import  
ins Repository ($CVSROOT) kopiert (under Angabe sog. vendor und release tags)  
und danach sollte man ein mkmodules ausfuehren, um die importierten Sourcen  
als Modul ansprechen zu koennen.
cvs add ist sinnvoll, um neue Sourcen in ein bestehendes Repository zu  
integrieren.

I posted this to Comp.os.os2.advocacy a couple of weeks ago. There is
obvious interest and misunderstanding, so I'm posting it here.

Francis


The following was taken from BYTE, March 1993 without permission:

``Testing cc:Mail in the BYTE Lab gave us the opportunity to
explore an alpha version of cc:Mail's OS/2 2.0 client (see screen
A). We ran the client on an IBM PS/2 Model 90 running OS/2 2.0,
which was connected to our NetWare host via the NetWare requester
for OS/2 and an SMC (Standard Microsystems Corp.) EtherCard Plus
Elite/A Ethernet adapter. We found that cc:Mail for the OS/2
Workplace Shell (the client's official name) lives up to its
lengthy title -- it is one of the first applications we've seen
that truly exploits the WPS (Workplace Shell).

``Because the cc:Mail folder is a standard WPS folder, you can use
the normal Control-Shift-drag procedure to ``shadow'' the objects
it contains (i.e., an in box, public and private mailing lists, a
folder list, and a message template) to the desktop for quick
access. But just dragging these objects to the desktop, without
the Control-Shirt modifier, achieves the same result, because
objects in the cc:Mail folder exhibit shadowing as their default
drag behavior. This is just one example of the useful
customization available through the WPS API.  If you check the
cc:Mail folder's ``work area'' option (another standard feature
of WPS folders), the shell will retain the state of your cc:Mail
objects and restore them -- opening and placing windows as
needed -- when you reopen the folder.

``As with the Windows cc:Mail client, each of the cc:Mail folder's
child windows presents a row of SmartIcons that make nearly every
function locally available. However, right-clickable context
menus localize control even further. In Windows you create a new
folder by way of the MDI (Multiple Document Interface) parent's
File/Create Folder menu option. Under OS/2, the folder list
floats free of a containing MDI parent; you create a new folder
by right-clicking and choosing Create Another. You can also
reorder any of the list-style displays (messages, folders,
addresses) by clicking at the top of the column that you want to
be the primary key.

``Drag-and-drop behaviors abound in the OS/2 cc:Mail client. To add
a user to a private mailing list, you drag an entry from the
address book and drop it onto the list.  To move a message from
the in box to a folder, or between folders, you drag and drop.
This internal drag-and-drop capability resembles that of the
cc:Mail Windows client. But the OS/2 client goes further; There
are various drag-and-drop operations that extend past the
boundaries of the cc:Mail folder and the objects it owns. To mail
someone a file, you can drag a file icon from a folder and drop
it on a message template. (The Windows version can in principle
accept drops from File Manager, but currently it does not.) Or
you can drag individual messages to the desktop or to other WPS
folders, where they can freely intermingle with data objects that
represent ordinary files.

``You can also drag a cc:Mail message template from the Templates
folder. The resulting customizable object acts as a new kind of
private mailing list that can contain boilerplate text and
attachments and can accept dropped files. Moreover, cc:Mail makes
the entire WPS mail-aware: Every file object's context menu
offers a ``cc:Mail It!'' option that invokes a message template
containing that file as an attachment. It's a please to see the
WPS's rich programming model exploited to such good effect.''

Hi,  

    I need a very simple question answered.  

My program needs to look at a data file and do the following: If a certain
character is in position 1, my program needs to read some other chracters
in the line.  If that control character is not in position 1, it should just
skip to the next line.

The problem is that if I write it with two consecutive
read statements (one that reads the first character to see if it is the correct
control character, and one to read the following data if the control character
is present), the program drops to the next line in the data file when it
reaches the second read statement.

All I need is some way of telling it to not drop to the next line, or a way
to back it up one line.

Any FAST help would be greatly appreciated!!!!!!!

Thanks,
Nick

This is roughly what Watcom NT does; here's a comment from 8087cw.c:

/* This is the default value loaded into the 80x87 control word.
   If you want higher precision, then change PC_53 to PC_64.  The
   reason we have the default set to PC_53 is generate reproducible
   floating-point results regardless of the level of optimization
   chosen for the compiler.
*/

Well, they do it for slightly different reasons (without optimization, a 
fstp/fld will round to 53, with optimization, the fstp/fld might be
avoided, resulting in 64 bit accuracy in places); but the net effect should
be IEEE results.

After all this talk of what the best, I would like an answer..

Which image-processing software is best? In terms of speed? in user-
friendliness? in amount of tools? in price/performance ratio?

Which company is MORE likely to support new image and ANIMATION formats?
Which one handles "morphs" better? WHich can convert more formats of
images and ANIMATIONS?

Please help out,
Thanks

PS- Please support the idea of "Quicktime" for Amiga? Will it ever happen?

In the meantime, before you reboot after an install, just do a

KLASSE! dann laufen demnaechst alle in der stadt mit riesen koffern rum,
weil man ja seinen Laptop, sein Autoradio, seine Fotoausruestung, seine
Sonnenbrille, seine Aktentasche ... nicht im wagen liegen lassen darf,
weil die versicherung meint, sie koennten zu leicht geklaut werden.

so langsam sehe ich immer mehr ein, dass es ABSOLUT sinnlos ist,
zusaetzliche versicherungen abzuschliessen.

in den situationen, in denen gegenstaende geklaut werden koennen, sind
sie nicht versichert und unter den umstaenden, unter denen sie 
versichert sind, koennen sie ueberhaupt nicht geklaut werden.

echt stark.

That may be so, but I don't think it would have helped much in my case.
I did not write the program, I did not/and do not fully understand what
the program is trying to write, and I suspect that the scratch file
and therefore the record size depends on the size of the problem, so I
don't know this information at compile time.

Personally I don't rate the Infocom games that highly - to me their puzzles
seemed obscure at times. Hitchhikers suffered dreadfully from being 6 or 7
very small adventures joined into one big one as well...

The best text adventures I've ever seen are the things Level 9 did. They did
a rework of Colossal Cave, and two sequels, and they were really good - my
favourites were the other trilogy they did, which was set in space. These games
just had so much to do in them, so much text and excellent puzzles, in all
fitted into 32k on a BBC micro! They did make the games for plenty of other
formats as well though.

They moved on to add graphics to their system (just pictures, no walking little
men around the screen or anything) and did about another 4 or 5 more games
before winding up to concentrate on sierra-type graphic games. Haven't heard
from them since.

In the light of some new innovations in multimedia from other platforms,
I was wondering if C= or other group/programmer has considered creating
a "Quciktime"-like format for the Amiga to play animations and sound off
the hard disk, be able to access any frame in the animation, be able
to "skip" frames to maintain speed of frame rate, and such...
Or are other companies creating ways to do this with formats like
ANIM-8, and the standard sound format..(which can be improved)

Just askin', as it would seem the Amiga would do a good job and would
benefit from such a format or technique to play LONG animations AND
soundtrack (especially if it's off a 16bit board!) without worrying
about RAM, animation manipulation , beating tha pants off a Mac and/or
PC..(for those who demand this from an Amiga..)

More info and posts are appreciated.

MS can afford to cut the price to ridiculous levels. They've got profits

: those on the supported list and has had the rights to NextStep from way 
: back when -- they obviously aren't interested.

The list of supported machines given was for the March Beta release. It's
very possible that more machines will be supported by the time it's released
in May. The other article you posted said that more machines would be 
supported in an August release. That sounds reasonable to me, since it
gives NeXTSTEP time to gain a little recognition and some good reviews.
A _lot_ of people haven't the faintest idea what NeXTSTEP is. They aren't
likely to run out and grab it in May. However, they may figure it out by 
the time of the later release, when hopefully, their machine will be
supported.

IBM didn't use Mach, so they had to imitate Mach messaging in AIX, which was
horribly slow. NeXTSTEP 2.0 came out, using more of those things, which would
have made an AIX version even slower. Apparently, an RS/600 wasn't much
faster than an 040 NeXT when running IBM's munged NeXTSTEP. That's why they
ditched it. There was also some politics involved. The whole story is in
the May 1992 issue of Upside Magazine. I don't think their license is valid
anymore. I guess IBM can afford to throw away 60 Million.

Oops. Just read a little further into the article. The original deal was
for 60 Million, but when IBM pulled out, they agreed to let NeXT keep
$30 Million.

Interesting quote in the article:
"According to an IBM insider, 'IBM simply couldn't afford to put that
good a solution on Unix.' Nextstep was just such a good solution."

And also,
"Finally, a request from IBM came over the transom asking if Next wouldn't
be kind enough to produce a nonobject-oriented version of Nextstep"

The article also alledges that IBM was pressured by Gates to derail Nextstep.
Very good article, overall. NeXT takes some shots, it's not a rah-rah
article.

i've had my experiences with the Amiga and the IBM.
I have both computers sitting in front of me...

if you talking about games, nothing beats the Amiga!
IBM has an enourmous selection but most of them are aweful!
IBM is only good for thier 20 Meg role playing adventures.

I thought that when i bought my IBM that would be it for the Amiga.
but i've found myself going back to the Amiga more and more.
right now the IBM serves it's purpose as the Business computer but for overall
fun and over "computer I would use" i'd take the Amiga, always!

to say it again and again, I alot of things on a 68000 7mhz Amiga than on my
486 33mhz PC!

so i too will still hang on to my Amiga!

    ok. I have been running the beta flawlessly on my ide. I even have a
    cd-rom hooked up via, the adaptec card. I got my hands on a couple of scsi
    drives, and I want to re-install OS/2.

    I have tried *many* differnt configurations. If you dis-connect the
    CD-ROM, and connect the scsi drive(s), OS/2 actually picked them up, adn I
    was able to format them.

    BUT, no matter which controlers are in, both, or just the scsi, I can not
    install the beta from floppy. Each and everytime it crashes on disk 2,
    while installing the bhsvga.dll (something close to that).

    Is there a way to cure this? I don't have much of a problem with the card
    recognizing the drives...OS/2 just doesn't like them.


                                                cheers,
