It's on p277 of the Corgi edition of Good Omens (in a footnote).  The Blues 
Brother didn't invent Curl Up and Dye -- there really have been hairdressers
with that name!

The section on Dutch tulipmania is particularly interesting.  I think Neil

Glad it went okay.  Did they get a good house?  My feeling after watching them
in Bridgewater is that they're cutting out plot in order to get in more stage
business -- but I guess that's because it's dawned on them that everyone in the
audience knows the plot _anyway_.

I've been doing some note re said daughter.  It might just work.

What about charging used magic lamps?  Can it be done/does it work?
example:
Find lamp, rub it and get a puff of smoke.  Bless it, rub it again and 
get wish.  Now I have just a plain lamp.  Can this be charged again to
make a magic lamp?  Can any lamp be charged to make it a magic lamp?
How many times can a magic lamp be recharged?

Here, for the FAQ, is the definitive explanation of the alligator joke
from Lords and Ladies:

It is (I hope) obvious that Granny Weatherwax has absolutely no sense of humour
but she has, as it were, heard about it.    She has no grasp of how or why jokes
work -- she's one of those people who say 'And then what happened?' after you've
told them the punchline.  She can vaguely remember the one-liner 'Give me an
alligator sandwich -- and make it snappy!' but since she's got no idea of why
it's even mildly amusing she get confused...all that she can remember is that
apparently the man wants it quickly.

There.  That's about enough for my Ph.D, I think.

Terry

And just to get in ahead of you all:

"And then what happened?"

Um den Fall geht es ja genau. Wenn ich explizit nur ein Geschlecht
meine, kann ich es auch nennen. Will ich beide ansprechen, kann ich
a) mich grammatisch fuer eines der beiden entscheiden, 
b) eine kuenstliche Kombination a la "StudentInnen" bilden
c) immer explizit beide Geschlechter nennen ("Studentinnen und
   Studenten" - hoffentlich fuehlt sich niemand wegen der Reihen-
   folge diskriminiert!)
d) versuchen, darum herumzureden, indem ich Wortformen wie "Studie-
   rende" benutze, die fuer beide Geschlechter gleich aussehen.
   (Wenn ich staendig im Plural rede, gelingt das sogar mit den
   Personalpronomen.)
Ich stimme mit Dir ueberein, dass Moeglichkeit b) zur Lesbarkeit nicht
unbedingt beitraegt. Sie hat ueberdies viel von ihrem urspruenglichen
Provokationswert verloren. Moeglichkeit c) ist etwas umstaendlich, in 
Einzelfaellen aber ganz brauchbar (IMHO). Nummer d) finde ich einfach 
unertraeglich, sowohl was das Sprachniveau, als auch was die Methode 
(bloss alle Widersprueche zukleistern!) angeht.
Von mir aus soll das aber jeder machen, wie er will. (Oder jede, wie
sie will - mein Gott, da haben wir's schon wieder!)

I think you can only install operatiing sytems on hard disk #1 or

but Im not sure you'll have to check with someone who knows more I just

A "good" bad movie is an artform all its own.  Let's see if I can break
it down into pieces.
1)  It has to be a movie that even if it were done seriously, would
still suck (most "good" bad movies fall into the "B"-rated genre, so
I'll use them in my examples)
2)  The plot is usually really cheesy, and if the story stuck to the
plot, the movie would run, oh, 10 minutes tops
3)  The acting... if you can't laugh at the bad acting, then it's not a
"good" one.  (For example, Ishtar misses because Dustin Hoffman is a
brilliant actor in the movie, he just had nothing to work with
scriptwise, but Sorority Babes at the Slimeball Bowl'o'Rama has
absolutely no good acting in it)
4)  The script... the script should be bad writing with a few really
good lines in it
5)  How easily can you make comments or heckles that add humor to the
movie?  (This is not just in the script, but in costumes, sets, etc)   A
"good" movie should allow one to talk most of the way through it. 
(Casablanca is NOT one, because it's a movie that you just can't heckle,
but Slave Girls from Beyond Infinity is a prime target.)
6)  Depending on the person... unnecessary naked breasts, pointless
violence, mindless drivel, strange little creatures, screaming, running
women, strong women, and several other things play big factors in their
appreciation of a bad movie.
7)  The final point... the movie is terrible, and yet you watch it
anyway.  You enjoy it.  You'd even see it again.  You recommend it to
your friends.  You had more fun watching that than you did watching a
"real" movie.  If that's the case, then you've probably found one.

That's right, Wasteland was done by INTERPLAY and Fountain of Dreams
was NOT.  I'm in the photo of the "band of desert warriors" inside the
package, although I only played a minor role in the scenario
development.

This is a fallback to the days when Linux had only the Minix filesystem. If
you want to use the Minix filesystem, you are limited to a partition size
of 64 Mb.  Don't despair, though... the ext fs allows something like 4 Tera-
byte size partitions.  I think this number is the same for xiafs and ext2 as

Spoilers ahead.

Ok, ok, I finally went to see The Crying Game today.  Somehow, I had
successfully avoided hearing "the secret", but I had heard there WAS a
secret, plus I had heard the film had a lot of plot twists.  My expectations
for the film were rather high.  Oh what the heck, I've got the flu and I've
been taking prescription pills all week, so maybe that affected my
judgement/thinking (FWIW, The film has been in town for a few weeks, I
figured if I went to the matinee, maybe I wouldn't infect as many people,
there were only 10 or 12 people there - it was really that empty).  Anyway,
here goes:

The big secret is that Dil is a man?  I mean, that's it?  I suspected that
was the case the first time Dil and Fergy fooled around when Dil wouldn't
let him feel under his/her skirt (and I was heavily narcotized at the time). 
When it was revealed later, I didn't think that was THE secret.   For some
reason, I was expecting something else.  Late in the film, I kept expecting
some new twist, something big, SOMETHING, instead it just kind of
fizzled/sizzled to the end.  Help me out here, did I miss something (and
please, no flames telling me that if were cooler, hipper, whatever, I would
"get it" - I'm too sick for that arrogant nonsense now) or is this film as
straight forward as it seemed (to me)?

For what it is worth, I'm not trashing the film.  I thought it was pretty
good, parts of it were very well done.  Maybe I'm just trashing the hype,
the mystique of the "big secret".  Then again, maybe I did miss something
(did I mention I'm sick??  Say, could you pass me the bottle of
hydrocodones....).

     The first Nosferatu was a silent German film, not from the late 30's 
but the early 20's.  It was EXCELLENT, very expressionistic and moody.  
Check it out sometime.

He folks,

I didn't see any comment on one of THE BEST FILMS EVER MADE:

Time Bandits !!!!! After BRAZIL the best movie that Terry Gilliam made!


Just remember Napoleon , Penzy and Robin Hood (aaaah... John Cleese !
Did you all se him in this english movie where he plays a shool-director?
I dont know the title in the Moment. GREAT STUFF!)

Just remember all the stars (like Sh. Connery as King Aggamemnon)
Or remember GOD in the End and all the stuff with "concentrated BAD!"


And remember the MUSIC by George Harrison (by the way: Is this CD available
ANYWHERE ???)

So you see, Good Stuff, REAL cult-movie stuff......WHADDAYA THINK ???


Cheers, M.F.

In fact, why bother with compression at all? All you really need to pass 
is a filesize and CRC result, and a fast random number generator could 
automatically recreate the data within an acceptable time limit.

Having watched this discussion, another GURPS GM and myself 
considered how to adjust mana levels dynamically. One thought was to 
start adjusting the mana levels as the mages begin casting spells. If 
the mages cast intensively over a short period of time the mana in 
the area is affected. In other words the mana is taking notice of the 
activity and is reacting. 

Assuming normal mana is typical; the following is a random mana table 
for the GM's use: 

 3 none
 4 none
 5 low
 6 low
 7 low
 8 normal
 9 normal
10 normal
11 normal
12 normal
13 normal
14 high
15 high
16 high
17 very high
18 very high

The mana levels in the area could change several times during the
course of a battle, etc. GM's discretion.

I suppose there are other expn programs floating around.  Probably
even one in perl...   

I wanted to try writing some socket code in perl -- I never had
before.  So I started writing and before I knew it, I had a 
pretty good mailing list exploder.  The total time investment in
this program is about five hours so far.  I tried to cover every
case, but it is possible (read likely) that I missed someting.
Let me know.  

As far as I know, this does a great job.

P.S. If there are any updates to this, they will be available 
by ftp from idiom.berkeley.ca.us
P.P.S. I know they style isn't great -- this was a five hour
hack job.

Well, that crosshair isn't a fixed piece of wire in your head, chummer,
it's an electronic image. It's never going to be any larger than the size
it's programmed to be. If the computer blows up the image of the target
and then applies the crosshair, it's not going to obscure anything.
Now, you may think that it couldn't work this way, but there's a good
example of a system working just like this today - Those neat little
IR sensors you saw B&W footage of in during Desert Stomp.

MERGE the card, download the files into main memory, move them to PORT 0,
purging them from main memory as you do so, and then FREE the card, using
the list on level two to specify which objects you wish to move from PORT
0 to the newly free'd card.  Works every time.

TOO MANY 1's IS UNHEALTHY!

Hurry up and release your 1-bit minimizer software, Steve!  Not only
do 1's effect battery life but now it seems that there is even a
health risk involved.

You know how all electrons have a left-handed spin?  Well, if you get
a disproportionate percentage of 1 bits in RAM, there is a collective
effect of a virtually immeasurable torque to the entire calculator.
Combine this with Ray's insight that 1 bits make the HP48 heavier, and
the result is easy to imagine.

Although harmless when used on a desktop, those who use the HP48 in
their hand may begin to experience discomfort after extended use.
Studies have determined that after a sufficient length of time, the
user may develop carpal tunnel syndrome and sue his or her employer.

Until Steve announces his sorely needed software (no pun intended), an
obvious workaround would be to keep two RAM cards in your HP48, with
one of them inserted upside down.

i personnaly like the LEGEND interface. And they have just come out with

but i don't think you can just take a book series and create a game that
incorperates the good bits from the other books. The should be liek a
nother book in the series that just happens not to be quite linear and
the reader has more control.

just my opinion  and what do i know.

where I used to work, as a programmer/general support person for a group
of about 20 people, I (1) worked among everyone else (2) - and it was great.
I was able to backup on almost any task, and when I did, I would see that
some part of the interface sucked, or the printouts were (currently) more
useful if done another way, or if we had an access point here... etc.

it was _great_ - and highly productive - to catch things even before the
users complained about them.

a highly recommended situation for places without huge personnel budgets
who want happy workers and productivity.  of course, if you're a mainframe
shop with a backlog measured in months instead of days, forget it.

But is it really relevant? With that sort of reasoning the best would
be to optimize the entire program away. Blazing fast, but nothing would
be done.

Character these days is, at least, an eight-bit entity, so treating
them as seven-bit must be regarded as incorrect. Sure, some people
may get around on seven bits, but if they are really concerned with
the loss of effeciency they could reconfigure Perl to use signed char,
rather than people who simply want the correct function should have
to mingle with the code.

Ok...from what I understand, an ALPHA version of software is software
that is released, but not completely finished. BETA software is totally
finished, and only needs to be debugged. The October "BETA" did not
have all the features implemented, therefore it was technically an
"ALPHA".  Therefore, if the "Fully functional beta version, Beta 2" actually
does ship in March (remember it was promised as early as October, if not
earlier...), Windows NT will only be in BETA for 3-4 months? Windows 3.1,
which are more or less a bug fix for Windows 3.0 with a few little features
added on (remember that multimedia support was available for Win3.0) was
in BETA LONGER than WinNT is going to be. Actually, DOS 5 and DOS 6 have
been/are in BETA longer than WinNT. 

WinNT is a brand new OS (contrary to the name...3.1) , with 30 MB+ of code,
and features that are not found in many OSes. Not to mention that fact
that it is ported to more than one processor, etc...etc...etc...

Therefore, 3-4 months is plenty of BETA time?


Can you say bugs??

I am starting to worry about this new MS trend to ship *REALLY* buggy
products, like Access...

That may be so today, but hasn't always been so.  Dr. Watson logs were
eagerly sought by MS Windows 3.1 developers during the beta.  I know
that a problem or two that I had encountered was, in fact, fixed after I
submitted a bunch of information, including, at MS request, those logs.

For the most part these days, though, I suspect problems one might have
tend to be with drivers more so than with the Windows code itself, so
the Dr. Watson log might be of interest to those who supply the video
(or other) drivers you use.

If you're not encountered problems, though, there's no point in running
Dr. W.

ok, i've downloaded the dbm from berkeley,
db.tar.Z, i assume my system uses the old
dbm or whatever comes on a next standard.

now, how do i switch the old to the new?
how does perl know where to get it from?

does anyone have some sample code for dbm
stuff, especially with db from berkeley?

thanks,

joe ( with visions of doing all kinds of good
hash table lookup stuff in his head ).

O.K. TeXsters....

Here is a real easy one. I am using regular article, report,
letter .stys in emtex's latex. I want to turn the page numbering
off for the title page and the first page of written text and 
THEN turn the page numbering on at the second page of text.

This is probably compeletely FAQ but I can't seem to figure this
one out.

True, but you can always put direct calls into your VBX since it's a DLL.
That seems to be the way most VBX makers are doing it these days.  So, you get:
	
	Success% = MailSendMail("William", "You are a wise man")

Not the same, but useful!

I don't think I was commenting on anything you did or did not say, but
I do not remember. My post had to do Mike Eagers original correct post,
and the comment he received from someone over in the UK whose name I
forget.  Did you post on the topic too?

You are right. I apologize. That was not my intent.

However, I will also add that I was not "tired of answering a stupid
question". If that were true, I would not have posted a long and
detailed answer in an effort to help. If you look at my post from which
you extracted the above, I think you would agree, would you not?

And finally, as usual, the problem in all these groups and articles is
that we tend to focus on one piece of minor stupidity someone does (me
in this case) in an article, ignore the rest of the stuff in the
article (which was relevent), ignore the fact that the response was not
a flame of any kind (nor intended to be one), and hand out electronic
slaps on the wrist irrelevent to the topic. Was this really worth it?

I will shut up now.

    Actually, I was in town for the Chinese New Year's run, and the
most obnoxious people I met were a couple telling AIDS jokes while
waiting in line.  Unfortunately, they had tickets :-(

    Any community, be it the deadheads or just those of us lucky
enough to be on the net, can set written or unwritten standards of
behavior.  Individuals who want to benefit from the community have to
abide by those standards in order to get what they want.  It's
really quite simple.

   In particular, *we* can do that with rec.music.gdead.  Anyone who
wants a ticket can be told, politely but firmly, not to bother the
entire newsgroup with their request.  Sure, some people won't get it,
but you can't run a society by catering to the tiny fraction who don't
understand the social compact.

PS: do you *really* find the miracle-seekers (perhaps that should be
"miracle-suckers" :-) outside the shows to be so obnoxious as
individuals?  Or is it that they contribute to the "ticketless horde"
problems which have cost us so many good places to see the Dead?

Only to the extent that the license itself does.  Or rather, only to
the extent that it appears to to me.  If I have a service set up
whereby I'll write freely available software to disks and send them out
for $5 apiece regardless of contents, as I read the license this would
mean I couldn't make Diku available.

Yet I can't see that this differs in any significant way from someone
picking it up by uucp from uunet.

This is equally true of the "$5 for the disk" charges that people doing
free software distribution often want.

So are UUCP charges for someone getting from uunet.  So are line
charges paid by someone who FTPs it and has a pay-per-byte or
pay-per-packet connection to the Internet.

I almost agree with that.  Not quite, though; it depends on what you're
after.  If you're trying to place restrictions on people, especially
people with whom you have no contract, you'd better have good legal
grounds.  If you're trying to use the law to your advantage, it is
always good to consult with a lawyer familiar with the field.

Now, if I see something that's marked "Copyright 1990 Joe Hacker.  All
rights reserved.  Non-profit distribution of changed or unchanged
versions in source or binary form without fee is permitted.", then
presumably the intent is to prevent for-profit redistribution.  The
notice I gave may or may not do that; it'd have to be tested in court.
If Joe Hacker is unwilling to accept the consequences of a mistake (in
this case, unwilling to accept for-profit distribution), Joe should go
talk to an intellectual property lawyer about writing a tighter
copyright.  I don't do that, because I am willing to accept the
possible consequences of holes in the copyright markings I put on my
software.

It may be that I'm wrong about the Diku license; it may stand up if
challenged.  But it seems that the authors really care about its
validity, which leads me to advise that they get an expert legal
opinion on the matter.

Well yes.  That's why I phrased my reply as I did:

This is just a pragmatic matter.  I'm sure there are far too many
violators for them to sue them all even if they spent the rest of their
lives at the task.

>> An agreement between you (presumably your "us" refers to the Diku
>> authors) and the University cannot bind third parties anyway,

Okay, this is based on my understanding of the North American legal
system.  It is possible (though IMO unlikely) that the legal system in
place in Denmark does allow agreements between two parties to bind
third parties, in which case it is less unreasonable to bring suit on
that basis.  However, I very strongly doubt that it could have any
effect, except possibly on violators in Denmark, because a breach like
this, without damages, is hardly an extradition offense.

I wished not so much to comply for the sake of blind compliance, but to

Yes, my strict reading would require me to go drag the whole thing out
and include it in this post.  I won't do this; once was enough.  Diku
group, if you really want to bring suit against me as a result, feel
free.  I fully expect you to fall flat on your faces if you try.

Sorry to disillusion you, but that's not really the main reason I'm
avoiding it.  I avoided it for many months between first learning about
its existence and reading that notice, simply because I don't care for
combat muds.

They have a legal right to, yes.  But that's about as far as it goes,
IMO; it would probably be equally valid to put in a clause like

	In order to be permitted to use this software, all persons
	administering a DikuMUD must stand on their heads for at least
	ten minutes in each 24-hour period.

But that would produce either laughter and non-compliance or laughter
and going looking for another mud, depending on how seriously it's
taken.

I ran the Dark Sun campaign yhis summer and had some really interesting time
with it.  We played the module Freedom and I think that the reason that it
lacks an ending is partly because it is based on the novel The Verdent Passage
and because the module is directly followed by the Module "The Road To Urik"

Hope I've been at least a little help.

Before some folks really get upset, I want to make a big correction
about one of the recent posts.

A reply to my message about A Whole New World making it to No.1 on Billboard's
Hot 100 chart said the Paige O'Hara sang Jasmine's part in the 
movie version.

Now, we know that that just isn't so. It was Lea Salonga. Hopefully,
this will avert a deluge of responses similar to the one received of
the question about Bruce Adler and Robin Williams as the peddler. 

So know, it was not Paige O'Hara (who was excellent in Beauty and the Beast)
but Lea Salonga who sang the part of Jasmine in the movie version of
A Whole New World.

   A couple of questions about Civilization, since I'm gonna buy it this
week for my Amiga.  First of all, I have a 500 w/ 1 meg, an external drive,
(no HD) and a 1084s Stereo Monitor (Hi-res).

In comparison to the IBM version with super-VGA and sound-blaster, how do the
following rate on the Amiga?

1)  the graphics
2)  the sound
3)  speed of gameplay
4)  speed of loading
5)  general enjoyability (although I think that this would be the same)

   I've been playing it on my friend's IBM and I love it!!  Sim-City taken to
a much higher level.
   Basically, I want to know what the Amiga version has that the IBM version
doesn't, or vice versa.

    Thanx!!

Hi,
May be you can help me.

I obtain the following estimate of the error of arithmetic coding:

           ----
0 <= R <=  \                  1           1
           /     Pi ( [ log  --- ] - log --- ) , where
           ----            2  Pi        2 Pi
            i

[.] - denotes the "near integer great",
Pi - denotes probability of the sympol i.

- This is correct ?
- Have you the better estimate ?
- May such estimate happend better for multiplication-free arithmetic coding,
  that for ordinary arithmetic coding ?

For those with PPage4.0 or PPage4.0a, Gold Disk recently 
posted a patch to PPage4.0A on Compuserve - I'm not sure
what it fixes, as I have not tried it out yet, and the
docs did not specify.  However, the ReadMe said there would
be a patch to the PPage4.0 genies released in the near future.

	I have a problem, I want to print a pretty huge TeX file (well,
a DVI actually) which is around 160 pages long. The problem I run into
is that after couples of pages sent to the printer spooler, I got an
error message from OS/2 telling me that I ran out of disk space (hey,
I've got 15 megabytes free on the drive I print from). 

	How can I remove the spooling "feature" for a short session
(this print)?  What can I do to solve my problem?

The East is Red is something like Deng Fang Bu Bai (unbeatable asia is
the English subtitle rendering of the main character's name) -- this
one was only made because people liked the character so much from
Swordsman II.

The original Louis Cha (Jin Yung?) charcter only appears as a "mention"
in the novel.  Having a woman play the castrated male was an odd move
but it did make the Lesbian scene interesting -- which is actually a
gay scene when one thinks about it (DFBB is really a man whose Kung Fu
has transformed him into the semblance of a woman and the serving girl
is actually a male ninja spy).

Life is weird and movies are weirder.
