No contradiction at all, actually i meant it the way you say. That's why i
wrote it would spare a lot of work to the teTeX people. The Debian way of
package management is based on developers/users to make up packages
according to certain Debian standards and thus enabling an easy way of
installation, upgrading or deinstallation without having a single person
to look after wrapping up nicely all those goodies. Debian Linux relies on
it's developers/users only and actually it works very well. Just looks
like developers in the LaTeX domain are still not really used to package
their great products according to the TDS.
