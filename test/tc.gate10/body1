Well, using "/usr/local" instead of "/usr/local/teTeX" doesn't change
the slightest thing regarding the ability to install it in your home
dir and regarding its self-containedness.

But my point is not that it should default to /usr/local (or /usr or /opt for that matter) but just that the self-contained directory structure could easily
accomodate for the cases when one want to put it in /usr/local (where
/usr/local/texmf might be less convenient than /usr/local/lib/texmf).

Anyway, as I said, I can live with <root>/texmf, really.

having it in sbin rather than bin doesn't prevent its use, it just
expresses the fact that this command is not intended for joe-user (just
like "mount" is not intended for joe-user, and yet I use "mount" sometimes
even on machines where I'm not root, just because I like its ability
to give some information on the status of a system which might explain
some of the odd performance I'm getting, for instance).
Also it reduces "name space clutter".

See my "mount" comment above.

I dont see the difficulty in tweaking kpathsea in order for it to look
in lib/teTeX/<arch> before (or instead of) PATH (actually, I'd rather
put them in libexec)

Basically the idea is: most users only use latex, xdvi, makeindex, bibtex
and dvips to the exclusion of everything else. Of course, some other commands
like tex, amstex, makeinfo, tangle and such are also heavily used by some other users but most other programs like virXXX, iniXXX, XXX.bin, pkXXX, XXtoXX
and friends will never be used interactively or only in some very unusual
circumstance, where it's OK to require the user to use the full path.
Of course, you might say "as long as there's no name clash, who cares" and
that's a good point.
