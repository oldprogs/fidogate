Hello,

a new version of isdn4linux is released as patch against 2.0.30, it should
work with 2.0.26 - 2.0.29 too.
It's available at ftp.franken.de /pub/isdn4linux/v2.0/isdn4kernel-2.0.30.gz.

HiSax 2.1 is included, the old teles driver is removed. 
The patch is sent to the kernel maintainer to include it in 2.0.31.

New HiSax 2.1 features are:
- improved Elsa Quickstep support
- Elsa PCMCIA support
- using SKB buffers
