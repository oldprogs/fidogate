	I was told by Louis Eggebrecht in December that there were plans to
allow Windows NT to run on the Amiga. He mentioned RISC chips and the
DEC ALPHA. He also said that the Power PC would not be used, although
they were looking for something that could handle multiple operating
systems.

	He also mentioned that CBM would use more mainstream technology,
and that the high end chip set would probably be expensive compared to
an a4000.
