Subject:      Card rulings and Proteus

Greetings,

My name is Byron and I have been a big Netrunner fan ever since I decided not
to play the same 3 Magic decks any more. I love the variety, strategy, and
utility of the Netrunner cards. I don't have a huge collection, but I think the
Wizards did a great job of making nearly every card really useful (there are a
*few* exceptions).

My first question is to Sparky. I read your post where you ask for patience in
regards to Joan of Arc/Misc. for Sale and also the recent question about the
Arasaka Portable Prototype/Shell Traders. One of your main points was that you
didn't want to make a ruling that only fouled up other cards later on. That's a
great idea, I agree, patience is always important (especially as the Runner),
but I have been trying to think of what problems these rulings could cause for
a while now, and I haven't been able to come up with anything.

I mean, if you just put out official WOTC ruling that said "Page 13 of  your
rulebook is correct. Cards *must* remain in the trash to generate bits for the
Misc. for Sale prep.", what other cards/combos would be affected? I can't
figure any out.

If the official WOTC ruling was "Shell Traders is not misprinted. You really do
install Arasaka Portable Protoype at *no cost*." would any other cards be
affected? Would that unbalance the game in some subtle way?

My final question is about the ICE card Ball and Chain. This seemed like a
really cool card, one I used a lot, when I played with it using the *common
sense* interpretation of how it worked. But when Rob Leachman told me how WOTC
wanted it to work, it vanished from my deck (and everyone else I have ever
played) and has never returned. What problems are being avoided by playing Ball
and Chain in this strange way (letting the runner see the next ICE before
deciding whether or not to pay for the Ball and Chain)? I hope it avoids some
terrible problem, because this ruling has turned this card into notepaper.

I guess I'm just saying I could go along with these rulings if someone at WOTC
would just post something explaining what problems are being avoided by keeping
these apparently contradictory rules.

I also think v2.0 definitely needs to reword cards like Cinderella ("this
damage cannot be prevented") and Arasaka Portable Prototype ("pay one agenda
point in addition to any other costs") and Shell Traders ("install, at no
cost"), so that two cards that are directly conflicting will have some way of
being resolved without an FAQ.

As for Proteus, I agree with the person that was concerned about the release
coming too early. I have had difficulty getting people interested in Netrunner
in my area, and adding an expansion with new victory conditions is only going
to make the situation worse. Magic is a juggernaut, but WOTC is the only entity
with the power to get people to switch over to their new, *infinitely better
built* card game. Until that effort is made, I fear Proteus could be the next
Dark Sovereigns (sp?). I think an expansion should be postponed for a couple
more months, after organized (and hopefully rated) tournaments become more than
4-8 person events. And introducing new victory conditions seems like a really
bad idea - WOTC has done such a good job with this game so far, can't they find
a way to incorporate the new card ideas into the existing rules structure (like
poison counters in Magic)?

Well, that's all for now.

Subject:      Joan/misc. saturation :)

I'm starting to look at the Joan of Arc/misc.for-sale discussion in the
same fashion I watched stories like the O.J. saga. I mean, at first they're
important and vital, and then they drag on and on, though you're sure it's
a foregone conclusion (guilty as hell), so you stop reading, but it's
always there, and it never goes away, until the jury passes down the wrong
verdict just so they can be done with it, too. (I'm sure Wizards will do
the right thing in this case, however. :)  )

The Joan/Misc. combination has even achieved that rarified illicitness that
belongs to hacker programs like AOHell. Read alt.aol-sucks, for instance,
and little kids post "duh, what is AOHell and how can I get it?" or "duh,
here's what I did with AOHell." Similarly, in trading.cards-misc and this
listserv, little kids post "I've heard so much about Joan and Misc -- what
is it and how can I get it?" or "here's what I did with Joan..."

It occurred to me today that my hope that the card combination will be
fixed in time for Pacificon is foolish, and that I might have to face
nothing but runners playing with Joan and misc. Ugh, how boring.

The fix I see repeatedly is that programs have to hit the trash in order
for misc.for-sale to pay off. I am sure that you clever Joan/misc players
will comply, making sure that no important programs are installed in your
Imp pyramids. :)

In other news, I liked that question where someone asked, "which cards
would you never play with?"

Um, Codeslinger, Record Reconstructor, Japanese Water Torture.

Subject:      The longest turn

One of my opponents at Skybox Pizza tonight taught me a lesson in patience
when he rolled a Playful AI sequence about 50 times before finally emerging
with a dozen bits. Then he used the bits to run a subsidiary fort that had
a Vacuum Link on it, and I rolled a couple of small numbers myself, sending
him back behind a wall a couple of times.

Hmm ... for Pacificon, I think I'll take a dozen Playful AIs, and hope a
few of them tie up my games as runner long enough for time to be called. :)

I know.I was involved in the last auction too,under a different

next auction.Wrong decision as we see.
I think with each auction the guys will pay more and more for the
cards.I need only about 20 cards to complete my collection and so I do
not care if I pay 3 or 5 UKP´s.Maybe brain damage ? <g>

   My experience with Chicago Branch is that it seems to run contrary to
speed, mainly because you have to invest actions and resources
protecting its vulnerable hide. When I first saw it, I was pretty
impressed, being inclined towards permanent advantages instead of
fleeting ones. If someone were to write about the "mindblocks of
Netrunner," this would be one of them, I think. I still play Chicago
Branch, but mostly because others still see it as powerful and will focus
their attention on it instead of the real business at critical times.
When they stop being distracted by it, then I'll probably stop playing it.

   Usually, by the time I see a Chicago Branch, I already have an
Executive Extraction down and scoring takes three actions (including the
installation) anyway.

   Another problem I have with Chicago Branch is its trash cost. In the
beginning of the game, a runner can usually get a turn running R&D before
I can get the bits to rez the initial ice. I want the runner to be
stopped by whatever they access during those early runs. Chicago Branch
won't do it; it just gets trashed and the runner runs again. However, a
Systematic Layoffs will stop the runner, generally.

   I also find on those occasions where the game reaches the stage where
the runner can run fairly frequently that Systematic Layoffs is of much
greater use than Chicago Branch for two reasons:

 1. Chicago Branch is usually gone by this point, its advantage lost as
well. Systematic Layoffs is still there waiting to be taken advantage of,
and;

 2. A Systematic Layoffs is not trashable, meaning that if it's in your
hand, it's just waiting to be selected by the runner (after a run on HQ)
who can then scowl at it menacingly, but that's all. :) It reduces the
probability of something interesting being picked...

   Comments? Derisions? Deleted Expletives? Death threats?

Yes you can avoid the tag even if it is during his turn. That is
basically his whole purpose.

Do trashing first not resolve trashing first. So You 1)trash 2)get bits
3)then prevent trash.

So if I used Gideons pawn shop as my next action would I have to return

Really?  Record Reconstructor I can understand (receives my vote for
most worthless card in the game, and I have 4 of the stupid things!) but
the other two can be very deadly.  My one and only Clown deck used JWT
and Codeslinger and Tinweasel.  4 Zetatech Installers, a few Tycho
Mem Chips and bunches of Clowns later, I only had to pay 1 bit to break
sentry routines; everything else was free!  This really put the pinch on
the Corp in the late game.  The problem was the elaborate setup, which
often took 7-8 turns to get working properly.  I also had Wilson and
a Bodyweight Data Creche so I was making many runs per turn.  With R&D
Interfaces and my Microtech AI Interface, I could run R&D 3 or 4 times
per turn at nearly no cost!  :-)

Just an observation.

Ok, so here we are 6 weeks after the release of the game.  And where are
we?

Corp players quickly recognized the power of Speed Advancement decks.  A
few others built Tag and Bag decks.  None of the decks were tuned very
much, but won 70% or more games in the first 2 or so weeks.  The decks
are not very clever, interesting or fun.

Then, a bunch of Runner decks, that were highly tuned, began showing
up and brought the Corp percentage down to about 60%.  Most of these
decks were still "normal" deecks (i.e., non-degenerate). That was good.

Then, the Corp decks started tuning their decks and brought the percentage
back to about 70%.

The Runners responded by finding a degenerate combo...the MFS/JoA.
Personally, I think the combination can't possibly work (Card A
says, "Trash X to gain 3 bits" and Card B says, "Prevent Card A from
being trashed."  It's pretty obvious to anyone that you can't collect
3 bits when you use both cards together. Oh well.)  Anyway, the official
word is that the combo works.  So, every Runner that wants to win has
to build a MFS/JoA deck.  And that deck is now winning most of its games.
IMHO, it's not very clever, interesting, or fun.

So, we finally have a kind of a balance.  If you are the Corp, you
must play Speed Advancement or Tag and Bag.  If you play Runner, you

Kinda.  If you ban the MFS/JoA combo (or just declare that it obviously
doesn't work), the Speed Advancement decks will rule.  So, you gotta
restrict the fast advancement cards.  But then, the Tag and Bag decks will
rule.  I'm not sure what you can restrict to slow those decks down.

Of course, WotC is very possesive about their game, so don't expect them
to ban or restrict cards or to change the rules any time soon.

Anyway, my original predictions for the game are still on track.  The
game has turned into a battle of degenerate and not-very-fun decks.
In six months (five now) it will dwindle down to just the hard-core
players with degenerate decks who can't find anyone (except other
degenerate decks) to play (much like what happened to Star Trek,
Star Wars, INWO, etc.).

"Of course," you say, "degenerateness is a fact of life in MtG and almost
every other CCG."  True.  But, it happened to NetRunner a lot faster than
it happened to most other CCGs.  And, most folks claim that degenerate
decks are actually the biggest problem with MtG and other CCGs.  It just
seems frustrating that WotC would release a new game that is an obvious
breeding pit for degenerateness.

I must be doing something wrong.
I happen to win most of my games as a runner (more, in fact, than as
a corp) and I don't even own a MFS.

And don't go saying something rude about my friends, please ;)

Your original predictions???  First, you are way off base with your
predicitions, and second-- who cares how clairvoyant you (think) you are?

Your analysis of "degeneracy" is very superficial.  There are lots of
ways to beat corp speed decks (mostly coming from the WAY the runner
plays, not the cards he uses-- as it should be in a great game),
and no need to restrict fast advancement cards.  Further, the
JOA/MFS combo is also not invulnerable, since setting it up requires
the runner to divert valuable actions (time) towards establishment and
drawing the necessary cards instead of running.  This is very often
a mistake against a good speed corp deck.

Play some more before you jump to such conclusions.

Also, I though in your last inflammatory post you wrote off Netrunner...
are you still playing this great game?

Run rabbit run,
David

These arguments have been presented too many times.  I have a better idea.
Let's let "them" say that "their" combo is legal.  Then, when they play it
against us, we kick their asses up around their ears.

You know what I really have a problem with?  If the trashing can be
prevented, but you still gain bits, why can't you prevent damage with a
Force Shield and then use Lifesaver Nanosurgeons?  The whole argument for
this lies in the following question, which was never answered when I
presented it as a rebuttal last week:  Does a Force Shield AUTOMATICALLY
prevent damage, or can you choose to let that damage pass through?  If you
can choose to let it through, then you also have to choose to prevent it.
Therefore, by the JOA/MFS illogic, this combo should work, too.  What, I
didn't take damage?  Well, you didn't trash any programs!

Either both have to be illegal, or both have to be legal.  You all know
where I stand.

This won't always work.  What if you have to shuffle your stack (resheduler)?
It would make it almost impossible to play.  Also, what if the Trap! never
comes up during the game?  The Corp will never know.

I happen to agree with a lot of his points.  The object of any CCG is to
create as much variety in deck construction as possible.  Unfortunately,
after 13 weeks, Netrunner has proved that it's no better than most when
originality comes into question.

I htink maybe that we can take a hint from magic here. when a card destroys
itself or something else of yours, it is considered to be sacrificed.
nothing can prevent a sacrifice. maybe the ruling should be that all cards
with trash: are considered sacrifices.

Is that me or syst. layoff costs 5 for 2 advancement ? Well, anyway
i find Chicago branch quite deadly especially coupled with the
wonderfull roving submarine (you install both at turn 2, with an ice

Well, it is your opinion, and i respect it. What i still don't
get is why you keep coming on this list telling us how bright
you are because you saw the light: this game is _bad_. We all
know you're this 30 years card games playtesters who has contri-
buted to all the successes in the industry and predicted all
the failures by now. I am not in any way the clever man you
are and not a professional either, but i played magic soon
enough, i played starwars at the beginning and quickly stopped
i would like to play more OnTE, and i can tell the difference
between something not very clever, interesting or fun.
let me tell you.

So, are you trying to say that this "Oh so incredibly degenerate combo
that kills everything in sight when you just think about it" is balancing
the game, so that it should be banned. "You see, i lose 50% of the time,
it so unfair"... great.

I still think that a deck made to take advantage of the combo with
loads of imps and such is lame. Now, i also think that the combo
in a deck which naturally has a lot of programs is cool... but not
overpowered, it gives a quick and nice help, quite a few bits and I
think that's what the R&D team had in head when they made mfs.
I could be wrong, but well... I think i am really tired of this
thread now. So, anyone that has found a really unbeatable deck with
the combo, please send it to the R&D team so they can fix it. If
noone has, live with it, cause it ain't broken.

MOAH still has to see a JOA or a MFS anyway...

Right.  Pay 2 when encountering the ice or jack out.  Sometimes jacking
out is a *good* thing for the Runner.  Ball and Chain doesn't compliment
black ice....

Not so.  I win with lots of deck ideas.  Including a pair of
Management Shake-ups does not make your deck a "speed deck."
There is a little more finesse required, or a good player will
smear you on the pavement.  There are also lethal poison-pill
decks (Namatoki-Viral Test Site), Trap Decks (Trap!-Setup),
Unbeatable ICE decks (Ice Transmutation+Antiquated), Expense
Decks (Closed Accounts + Red Herrings).  All of these are viable
strategies that will shut down a host of deck types.  What makes
the game easy to win is when cheeseballs use the same predictable
decks, so the other side just needs to find a way to beat one deck
type.  Idiot clones that go out and make the same deck as clones
A, B, and C deserve to lose.  If everyone would gamble a little,
use some OTHER cards and stop trying for the "I'm the biggest
cheese-ball around award" then we could see what the game was like.

I guarnantee that I will stomp the hell out of the first misc.Joan
deck that gets in my face and I'm not using either of the two
"suggested" Corp deck types.

As to the Runner, I've never had a problem winning consistently,
with an occasional loss here and there to keep me humble.  I have
never, and will never, use the misc.Joan combo 'cause I think its
stupid and illegal.  (I own two of each of the required cards.)
"Somehow", my newest Runner deck has gone undefeated against 4 different
Corp decks, two tuned, two random, with very skilled opponents
at the helm.  As I said before, the game is healthy and in good shape.
The cards are losing their freshness, and I for one would like to see
Proteus hit the shelves ASAP; this doesn't mean that I've stopped
building new decks, however.  I never keep a deck for more than two
weeks.  If one works really well, I put it on paper in case I want
to resurrect it again at some point (Oh, say, for a tourny.).

This is still not a problem.  First, it can be beaten.  Second, if
the people you play keep using the same deck because they're too
dumb to have fun, tell them they're assholes and stop playing with
them.  They will change, or they will not have anyone to play against.

I always have fun, even when playing a nob.  I don't think that many
card games are immune to this type of thinking, but since I don't
have to deal with it, I don't care.  I think most of us on the list
have tried a lot of different things, and we're still experimenting.
Some think they have the end-all decks for one side or the other,
but they WILL get beaten.  They just haven't found the right player
or the right deck to do the job.  I don't think anyone could predict
the outcome of a tourny with the players on this list as opponents.
We would see a lot of surprised faces, and we would hear a lot
of excuses, but the results would definitely be interesting.

I think you need to get a larger perspective Bill.  This is not M:TG,
Star Wars or Star Trek.  Keep in mind that most other games out there
have really BAD rules with really limited cards.  Netrunner is the first
game since Middle Earth that I think has a really good set of rules
and cards that remain fun.  This genre is evolving, and if the players
evolve with it the games will reamin exciting and cool.  If everyone
out there agreed with you, this game would suck for the reasons you gave;
this isn't happening anywhere but on the tourny cicuit, and those folks
are due to get slaughtered soon.  We're on to them, and we know how to
take them out...

Take a happy pill and get back to us.  :)

If he would come up with at least a half decent reson for why
the combo shold work according to the current rules, I might shut up.
If know how the Netreps from WotC are thinking and resoning to reach
this conclusion, I might learn somthing about how also other cards
and combos are to be interpreted. Until the opposite is proven,
I will assume that there is some consistent logic behind the
rulings.

It is not my intention to antigonize Sparky or R&D, even if I may have
a bit sharp in my statments. They have designed a grat game.
Hipp hurray for that.

Subject:      Rule questions

I have a coupole of rule question.
1)Can I choose to break subroutines in any order. For example
I have Dhalia and only two bits can I break the end the run subroitine
or does the trash a program subroutine hit me before I could break
the end the run subroutine.

2) If all the routines of a liche hit me ( 3 routines of do a brain
damage) and I have Araska owns you in my hand can I use it
or would they resolve seprately first makng me discard Araska and
then flatlining me.

3)If something does more than one net damage who picks the order
they hit the graveyard (important because of juckyard bbs)

Ian Petchey asked about Chicago Branch. I agree with his assessments that
the darn card is too easy to trash (especially from RD), and that it
requires a great deal of resource to keep it safe. For the second reason,
Chicago Branch is a prime candidate for Roving Submarine. Of course, Roving
Submarine is just as vulnerable as anything in the game and more attractive
to run.

What's my point here? Uh, I love both Chicago Branch and Roving Submarine,

I don't know about you, but when *I* shuffle my cards, their orientation doesn't
change - so the accessed cards will be 180 around after as well.

And...even if it never comes up during the game, the moment the game ends I'll

*DOH!* That's right, I missed that point. I wasn't here when the

missed that part. Remind me not to post on issues I haven't

It has been explained here more than once, and by Sparky "entre autres"
(terrible this loss of memory when i can't remember my proper english).
There is a rule that says: "If you can't meet up all the effects on a
card, you do all the effects you can, and forget those you can't"
So, when you play MFS then JOA, you play all the effects of MFS you can
("trash the programs i can't, get the bits i can") and forget those
you can't because they were prevented.
It's like if you have a card that says "Take 2 brain damage and win the
game" if you have a force shield in play. The 2 brain damages are not
done as they are prevented but you still win the game, ok ?

This is how it works, rules are consistent and they are clear. Some
people here don't want to understand them, because they think the
combo is too powerful. Maybe it is, but that doesn't mean the rules
are being broken.

Well, ok, but will the judges believe you. I mean a turned card isn't
much of a proof, and people could cheat turning cards in their deck
so they can accuse the other. I think the best way to handle this is
to have a judge behind each runner's back.

And so easy to do...

Brian, it doesn't matter *what* order you resolve them in!  It *clearly*
states on misc.for.sale: Gain 3 bits for each installed card TRASHED
this way.  If none of the cards go to the trash, then you don't gain
the bits!  Plain and simple...  If you let them go to the trash to gain
those bits however, then they certainly can't be prevented from being
trashed since they're already *in* the trash!!!  Too late to use JOA!
You can't use MFS and JOA in combo because it just doesn't work...

Well, you know why this is a neverending thread, don't you?
It's because WotC has issued a ruling that is so far away from
reality that the average intelligent person can't understand
why and feels they have to post about it.

Remember the Maze of Ith/Serra Angel ruling?  WotC ruled that
the Maze would NOT stop the Angel.  The stream of folks complaining
that the ruling didn't make sense and that it contradicted every other
ruling, kept its thread going for six months.  Finally, WotC reversed
itself and the thread stopped dead in its tracks.

>This list is just a cool way to get fast answers to strange questions,

Or strange answers to fast questions.

WotC WILL change the ruling for the MFS/JoA.  Since every single person
who first hears of the ruling automatically disagrees with it, WotC
will eventually reverse their decision.  Even if they don't do it for
the "right" reason (i.e., the ruling doesn't make sense), they will have
to do it because the combo will be dominating tournament play.  We know
from their statements on MtG that they ban, restrict or change the rules
when a specific deck dominates play and no other deck can reliably stop it.
Sooner or later they will follow their stated policy.

So?
It took about six months for R&D to decide if bleeding was a
directed action or not in Jyhad.
Did it stop people from playing? (And I can tell you, it's a much
more important rule point that JOA/MFS and the like!)

There is only *ONE* kind of meat damage! It's called... "MEAT DAMAGE". With
me so far? Meat damage which "cannot be prevented", cannot be prevented by
cards that "prevent all meat damage". Pretty simple how the English language
works, eh?

It's quite clear to the vast majority of us, I'm afraid. When something says
it can't be prevented, it can't be prevented. What's so bloody difficult
about that?????

>p.s. Constructs really don't have any meat.  :)

Sure they do. Well, not "meat" per se, but there has to be some kind of
physical housing.

And you'll get smoked every time by my speed corp deck with no damage and

Bolter Cluster, and that I have a Trojan Horse and Urban Renewal, and by the

Very true. But the fearful runner is the unprofitable runner. All the big
names like Spider Murphy aren't afraid of taking some burn to get what they
want. That's *why* they're the big names. Nobody ever heard of "Joe the
Cautious", because he leads a singularly uneventful life. And maybe he even
brings down a corp, but he does so in a decidedly unimpressive way.

Subject:      Setup & Speed Trap

Hello,
first I want to thank you for the contributions to this list. I am reading
it for 2 weeks and get lot of hints and a lot more of fun from hit. Please
go on.

Second I have a question. (I've played only 5 games of NR yet.) Yesterday we
had the following situation. Runner has installed

Speed Trap
Program-Detection-1 MU
[0]: Jack out before an upgrade or node takes effect. Use this ability only
immediately after the Corp has rezzed that upgrade or node.

and made a run on HQ. He accessed:

Setup!
Node-Ambush
When Runner accesses Setup!, it does 2 Net damage, even if it is not
installed. Ignore this effect if Runner accesses it from the Archives. If
Setup! is accessed from R&D, Runner must show it to you.

The question: Must the runner take the damage or not?
We decided he must take the damage. The Setup is not installed and it
states, 'does 2 Net damage, even it is not installed'. I read this as, I
need not to rez Setup to do the damage (and I can't rez a node in HQ too).
Speed Trap allows to jack out only after the Corp has rezzed that upgrade.
Result: He cannot jack out and has to take the damage.

Michael.

Possibly. Ever considered that maybe I'm just a better runner than any
you've faced? (okay... not likely... but possible)

They all try to be. But how could it possibly be deceptive? I mean, if I
don't care much whether you're using ambushes or not, I'm not going to be
decieved very much...

BTW, played against an improved ambush deck again last night. Was playing
with the worst of my 3 runner decks. Ran R&D as 4th action of my first turn,
and once again proved that Trap! is not fatal. Well, at least not
necessarily... Even on turn one. Run the corps always. Never let 'em rest.
(which is what I did... then I *needed* to run as often as possible because
the corp had 6 agenda points... got through to R&D with 2 interfaces,
trashed Experimental AI and scored Detroit police contract... ran again, cut
the top card to the bottom with AI interface, hit Setup! and Trap! both...
See? I should have ran more early in the game, rather than taking time to
install nifty interfaces and such.)

Subject:      Runner etc (reply to Stephane)

hi,
nope I don't work for wotc,the e-mail address published in the mailing list
is wrong/garbled/whatever.

Its good that you can beat corp decks most of the time with your runner deck,
but I think one has to ask himself what sort of opposition he is facing. It
may well be that their corp deck designs are flawed in some way, or they
simply do not have all the cool cards. (of course, I'm sure you're a good
player judging by the high level of common sense your posts possess [a
rare commodity])

AI CFO springs to mind. If AI CFO is scored early, fast
process corp is incredibly difficult (impossible  without JOA/MFS I would
say) to beat. (3 AI CFOS, the rest 4/3 agendas)

Unfortunately, its not possible to play NR on irc because R&D protocol files
doesn't work and its an integral part of runner decks (at least around here)
or we could play a few games :) [plug for #netrunner on irc]

Would you like to repost/post/e-mail me your non JOA/MFS runner deck? By
looking at it I should have a fair idea on how well it does :) You can tear
apart my fast process corp if you want, but its not terribly imaginative,
I mean.. "wow, a card that lets you score agenda in 1 turn. Can I build a
deck around this?" were my first thoughts after opening my 1st starter.

One final thought: why don't they just ban JOA/MFS and make the agenda points
needed to win higher than 7? This should hamper fast process corp :) Oh yeah,
ban tycho extensions. No one should win by just scoring *2* agendas.

        Alright... for those of you who have been on your annual vacation
in Borneo for the past month, I'll try and sum up what we've been talking
about:

        1) JOA/MFS is a horrible ruling since the card text obviously
implies that you have to actually trash the cards in order to get the
bits.  Anything else is illogical.

        2) JOA/MFS is a fine ruling since the card text obviously
implies that both effects are independant, and you get the bits
irrelevant of whether or not the cards actually hit the trash.  Anything
else is illogical.

        3) JOA/MFS is currently deemed legal by WotC.

        Yes, you can choose to break subroutines in any order.  However,
no subroutines take effect until after you have "dealt" with all of
the subroutines- either broken them, failed to break them, or not
tried to break them, so it doesn't really matter.

        They resolve separately- Arasaka Owns You is primarily an
anti-Bag card (although it is a tremendous resource to draw cards
in the right deck).

        The Corp picks the cards one at a time, irrelevant of how
much damage is dealt.  That's the order they hit the trash (I'm
not sure what a "graveyard" is, though).

        Card Text supersedes the rules.  Virus Test Site plainly states

        So?  If they have a Speed Trap, I don't want to rez it.
Furthermore, future cards could have an impact on rezzing nodes.

        This is true, but fundamentally irrelevant.  If the card text
states that you can have Virus Test State deal 2 Net Damage per
advancement counter while it is uninstalled (which it does), then
heck- if I somehow manage to get advancement counters on Virus Test
Site while it is in my R&D, then you'll be taking 2 Net Damage per
counter.

        How do you figure?  Structurally, the commas used implicate that
the "even if not installed or rezzed" part is a clause applying to the
entire sentence- not just the latter part of the conjunction.

        Listening Sparky?  How about an official ruling?

Maybe I was not very clear about the "risk" notion.
I didn't say that you shouldn't run if you might take some net damage.
I said that you should know if, in the following run, there is a chance that
you could be flatlined (or that the corp would gain a decisive advantage).
If the risk is zero, then you MUST run (or you should in about 90% of the cases.
However, your deck might require some preparation).

If the risk is different from zero, you must use the knowledge you have
about your opponent and his deck and run if you believe you have a fair
chance of hurting him more than he can hurt you.

I'm not paranoid. Most of the corps I play against find that I run far too
much for their taste.
But being a good runner is knowing when NOT to run, too.

Hi Michael.
Either you've got some way of screening JOA/MFS messages or you're

So, your question:

No, Speed Trap cannot be used when a runner accesses ambush nodes
for HQ (or R&D), because these cards have not been rezzed.

Life's tough but shields are cheap.

Thanks.
Some of my friends are nasty players, even if I must admit that I've yet

that people have trouble accepting that one can win more often as the
runner?

All the decks I've posted here are "fun decks", and that's the one I play.
I have yet to participate in a NR tournament with constructed decks, so I don't
feel the need to build killer deck. I do agonize over choices when building my
decks, but I refrain from being too cheezy (I usually limit the number of rares
I put in a deck - except for the "I am rich!" deck I built when I got my two
Shell Traders :)

I'm most succesful with Security Code WORM Chip which is about my favorite
card but, apart from Wilson and the 0 bits to break a subroutine breakers, there
are no cards I don't think twice about including in a deck of mine. And I
even try
to find good reasons for NOT including the previous ones.
But one day, I know, I'll build a 45-cards highly tuned killer deck from Hell.
I'll post it then (if it doesn't win ;)

Yeah! And ban Political Overthrow too.

Let's see how the corp deals with 13-cost agendas worth 2 points.

Um...  I thought it was the Runner that trashed the cards, not MFS.
This makes using JOA to save the programs you were willingly going to
trash even more ridiculous.

Why not?  You would have the bits available.

JOA does not *rescue* the cards.  It prevents them from hitting the
trash in the first place.  It's a prevention card.  It's preventative.
It prevents.

No, no, no.  Read the FAQ for Edited Shipping Manifest.  It is implicit
that you cannot receive bits for an action and then prevent an effect
before that.
The correct order would be:
1.  Trash.
2.  Prevent trash.
3.  Get bits.  Or not.

You can put as many advancement counters on an agenda every turn as you have
actions to do so, or cards that let you.  It takes one action and one bit to
put an advancement counter on an agenda, unless you've a card that lets you
do more with one action.

No it is not like that. To get the closest to MFS you'd have to have something
like this: Take any amount of brain damage you chose, win the game if you have
taken at least 2 brain damage.

And as with the ruling with Nanosurgeons, it would not work if you prevented the
damage.

Why don't they also ban Political Overthrow? You only need to score that and any
other agenda and you win! Outrageous! And what about Project Babylon?! You can
win with that agenda alone! I also think that they should ban the Evil Twin --
Ice breaker with damage prevention is way too unbalancing.  And lets not forget
about the record reconstructor. I am sure there are other cards that break the
game, but these came to mind right away.

I don't think it does.  MBD doesn't actually prevent the trashing of the
cards.  You choose whether or not to put them in the trash or on the
'Drive.  This is to emulate the use of a Backup Drive and is a cure, not
a

OK OK OK I have read all this stuff about degenerate decks and how the game
ends up with certain cards and that is all. First of all, realise that the
game still has not got the complexity of MTG. Second of all realise that FUN
is the reason games exist. Here is what I do: Sure I collect RARE and
powerfull cards such as Access through Alpha etc. But I play the game for FUN.

Chuck ALOT of cards in a deck +/- 90 or so. (both sides) and play with what
comes up. EVEN BETTER have 14 AGENDA points as V conditions and now you are
talking FUN, STRATEGY etc.

PLay a group game, 2 runners and 2 corps (or any other combination) each
draws from the COMMON runner deck (120 +) cards and COMMON corp deck. See
the ganging up, the backstabbing etc.

There we go, listen: DONT PLAY TO WIN, PLAY TO ENJOY!!!!

btw: anybody got any other ideas for group games?

Terrific idea.  And, that's pretty much exactly the way I play most of my
NetRunner, MtG, Guardians, SCTCG, etc. games.  Unless I am trying a specific
theme (or feel I have to play a stronger deck just to have a chance in hell of
winning), I almost always play my decks as highlanders and specifically avoid
cards that are generally considered overpowered.  It's always fun and
interesting to play WITHOUT known and expected combos.  That way I have to
"fly by the seat of my pants" and use cards in unusual ways to win a game.

But, how do you get your opponents to play the same way?  All too often
I whip out my highlander deck and proceed to get thrashed by amazingly
degenerate decks.  "Well, I AM playing a fun deck," they say, "what's more
fun than winning in 6 turns?"

I've tried simply not playing against players known to play killer decks,
but suddenly that limits my potential opponents to almost no one.  And,
of course, in organized play (i.e., tournaments and leagues), you can't
refuse to play certain opponents.

How do the rest of you folks force your opponents to play non-killer decks?

Well, I usually use my amazing powers of mental domination to
get them to play fun decks, unless I'm specifically trying out a
new deck and want to give it a shakedown. The other tactic is to
play them once or twice, see what kind of deck they're using, then
ridicule them in front of their peers for playing such cheesy cards.

This usually works quite effectively, especially with the insecure
teenage male types that play around here. Man, laugh at them a
few times and they're either almost ready to cry or get violent! It
seems as though nobody understands what psychological
warfare entails in this context...

Actually, I don't normally do this, unless a person demands it by
being a weenie. Typically, the people I play don't try to play evil
decks; they just do the best they can with what they've got. If
it's politely requested that they play something else, and they
don't, we just start another game without them. Works for every
game!

I hate to break it to you, but this isn't a facet of CCG's, but rather a
reflection of human nature. People are inherently more willing to copy
something that works instead of thinking for themselves. This is why
copyrights, patents, etc. exist...

It was well posted on the magic list how one of the players in the first
Pro Tour game copied his winning deck from someone else just the night
before.... Anything to win, eh?

It appears bad in CCG's because
1) someone will play something new, and then post about it
2) everyone who reads the net will try it, and also post about it.
They'll spread it locally also.

3) people are gullible. If you say something works, people will believe
it works, and if it loses for them, they'll blame it on luck
I've seen so many copies of bad magic decks that someone posted "hey this
deck kicks butt" and they all just accept it happily. The JoA/MfS stuff
is another one. Someone got it to work a couple times, posted, and
althoguh there are a lot of posts saying how long it takes to get the
setup going, because it was posted, people will play it.


The way to have a creative game is to have things spread slowly. Don't
post decks that work, make people think for themselves, and there will be
a much more creative game.

OK, here's the situation.  Action 1, you run on R&D revealing an agenda and
the Bizarre Encryption Schemes that the Corp had installed on R&D.  No prob
right, you just run again and score it.  Unfortunately, you don't have the
bits to make it into R&D again.  Actions 2 and 3, you run with the Record
Reconstructor.  Do it again on action 4 if you think the Corp can draw more
than 4 on its turn.
Ta da, the agenda is yours.

BUT WAIT, there's more:
Let's say that the agenda above was one of the 6 Corporate Wars that is in
the Corp's deck.  On the Corp's turn, it uses its AI officer and mixes up
its R&D.  The top card just happens to become a Corporate War.  Then the
Corp draws, and installs the CW.  Then on its fourth action (which the Corp
has many ways of getting) it uses a fast processor card and scores the CW.
How in the world is the runner supposed to know whether or not the CW scored
was the same one that s/he accessed in the first place?

No this has never actually happened to me, but I'm pretty bored right now.

Why don't you read the Roving Submarine card again?  If I install a Chicago
Branch, City Surveillance, or Blood Cat in a data fort, and then install a
Sub right afterward, the fort can't be run, period.  How exactly did you
plan to run on and trash it?

Well, what should we talk about then?
If I find an interesting way to win, I like to share it and I trust
other people to do the same. I don't pretend knowing everything
there is to know about NR. I even learned a strategy tip reading
Scrye! (it was a borrowed copy ;)

There are cards I'm not even thinking about that other players
find great and I'd like to know why. Not to "copy" their decks
or "steal" their ideas, but to learn more about the game and
augment my enjoyment.

Interesting question.
Maybe you could use a proxy card for the agenda that the corp doesn't have
in its deck. Something like a Wall of Ice (noone has Walls of Ice - I certainly
don't :)

Well, the card says:

"Install only inside a subsidiary data fort. This fort may be run
 only if you installed or advanced a card inside or on this fort
 during your last turn. "

So since you installed something during that turn (The Roving
Submarine, for example), it can always be run the first turn that you
put it out.

I'll give you a hint.  My deck is actually a speed deck, only using the
traps as a way of suppressing early runs.  If you throw caution to the wind,
you play into my hands.  If you're cautious, ditto.

Granted, you might be SO good that I'd never stand a chance against you in a

  You must take each subroutine in order. I believe that rule is in the

  Well, this question popped up before.. Unfortunately, you're not taking 3
brain damage.. You're taking 1 brain damage 3 times. The 1st point would
dump the
AOY, and the other two would come on through.

 When multiple cards of yours are hitting the trash (PuuuuLHEEEEZE don't say
graveyard. :)  ), you get to choose the order. The owner of the cards always
choose.

Yep. Because the Speed Trap states that you have to use it immediately
after an ambush node was rezzed. If you pull it from HQ, or even R&D,
it will do the damage, because you can't (and don't need to, for this
card) rez cards in your hand.

You're just slightly offbase ;)
You can break the subroutines of a piece of ice in the order you like.
Those that are left unbroken do take effect in the order they're written.

For most Runner's Short Circuit is a stable card, but seldom
needs frequent reminder visablity.   Chicago is a Corp Speed card
and often it's worth of ICE to protect it's fort.   I've stacked Banepi's
and then Jacked a Liche and it seemed that a 1 trash cost
was NOT worth the effort to make a run against it.

Advancing Agenda on a New SubFort in 2 actions is Standard.
Score/Bit-Gain nodes and then go for it!

In-Reply-To:  <199607221922.MAA21271@oracle.wizards.com>

I've been following the discussions on this mailing list for some time
now, although I have had very little opportunity to play, and I've got a
couple of questions:

1)      It seems to me that people prefer playing with Succubus instead
        of Zetatech Memory Chip, and I'm wondering why that is. After
        all, if memory serves, they cost the same to install and provide
        the same extra memory. In my mind ZMC has two advantages: if it
        gets trashed, you don't lose any other programs; and you can
        install it even if you're currently using all available memory.
        The only advantage I see for Succubus is that I can bring it into
        hand with Short Circuit; does that outweigh the above?

2)      If a runner accesses Bizarre Encryption scheme and trashes it,
        does it still affect the agenda? I feel it shouldn't, in which
        case what it actually seems to do is make the runner run all
        over again to score the agenda. Am I interpreting this
        correctly?

Thanks for any help,

It's a pretty big advantage. Plus, many cards help you prevent
program trashing or recover from it. I prefer Afreets, but that's me.

The reason it's degenerate is because, with the use of JBBS, you can run it
4 times in 3 turns.  It would be far more fun, and still a viable deck
theme, if those damn Imps just stayed in the damn trash.

"Degenerate is as degenerate does."

We *still* haven't seen this combination dominate tournament play, nor
have we received feedback stating that it's being done at non-WotC events.

I asked for first-hand accounts a week ago, and haven't received any yet.
Just a lot of complaints about it with no backing, as well as a lot of
'solutions' to something that hasn't been proven to be a problem.

The next rules team meeting is on Wednesday.  I'd really like to have
some information to share there....

No, I sincerely doubt it.  I think one of the cards will get errata before
we change the ruling.  The 'ruling' is a simple interpretation of the rules.
The cards take advantage of the rules in a particularly nasty fashion (IMHO).
That doesn't necessarily mean that there was a problem with the ruling or the
rules!

*WARNING:INCOMING FLAME*

Excuse me? I'm sorry, but I happen to LIVE in Richmond, Virginia,
and on average, we DO NOT CHEAT! I have played in very
enjoyable tournaments before, where I was beaten, soundly and
fairly. The opponents I played were very good sports about the
whole affair, and (since I was a new player at the time) even pointed
out to me exactly where the flaws in my deck appeared to be. So far,
their advice hasn't proven false.

Besides, you may note that this was an example of That Other
Game. That Other Game, on a whole, seems to be slightly more
competitive then Netrunner. Perhaps this is because in The Other
Game, lives are on the line, whereas Netrunner has more of a
playful feel to it (gee, I'm sorry I had to flatline that guy, but if he'd
just stayed out, he wouldn't have gotten hurt).

I must apologize to everyone who reads this (except, of course, for
the poster), but if you're going to say something bad about the
region in which a person lives, you can expect retribution.

*END FLAME*

Just my ? cents (the system can't really rate flames) on the issue,

Yes, but if we take this into account, you couldn't use Microtech Backup
on a Startup Immolator, and new rules would also have to be implemented
similar to "burial" in magic. One of the things I like about Netrunner is
that you don't have to constantly keep track of which cards are killed,
and which are destroyed, or buried, or incinerated, or discarded, or
removed from the game, or kept seperate, or mutilated, or cornholed.
Everything is just TRASHED. (except of course for cards you remove from
the game permanently).

Since you seem to know so much about sentence structure and content, I'm

Oh, and this question was answered in the latest Inquest, by none other than
our very own Sparky!  I don't want to have to say "I told you so", but...

Personally, when I play, I prefer if they Speed Trap out.  I don't want them
ruining my nice ambush nodes.  Heck, as far as I'm concerned, they're
agenda-scoring nodes.

Subject:      Enough Already!!!

The title says it all... enough!  If we spent as much effort discussing
Netrunner strategy instead of whining/debating about JOA/MFS, we would
probably find Netrunner to be even more interesting.

Let it be know (as almost everyone already knows):
- That Wizards has ruled that JOA/MFS is legal, for now.  It is, in their
own words, legal because JOA/MFS is consistent with the intended function
of Joan of Arc.  This doesn't mean they foresaw the combo; it simply
means they feel this combo does not violate any of THEIR principles
behind JOA or MFS as they originally conceived these principles.

- Wizards DESIGNED this game (as the last Duelist says in a footnote,
"Tom Wylie *is* the rules") and therefore it is safe to conclude that
they have spent a great deal of careful thought in constructing rules and
in making rules judgements.  Does anyone honestly believe that Wizards
ruled this way simply to piss off their customers?  Does anyone
think the rules staff at Wizards is simply stupider than he or she?
I believe the design of a good CCG is incredibly difficult, and I
strongly feel that there are levels of design considerations far deeper
than any of us currently understand.

I'm not saying I would have ruled the same way that Wizards did, nor
am I saying that everyone *must* play by the Wizards ruling.  But to
say that "you can't use JOA/MFS" is simply wrong.  Everyone is free
to play the game as you feel, but in tourneys until Wizards changes their
ruling (at least official tourneys), JOA/MFS is LEGAL.

Realistically, this does not in my opinion change the Netrunner landscape
in a major way.  Sure the JOA/MFS combo is a great way to get money.  It
suffers from other problems however, and I have actually witnessed or played
more JOA/MFS decks LOSE than WIN (about 10 games total).

I still think that the most important factor in the success of either side is
the way you play your cards and not the cards themselves.

So... anyone have any good Roving Sub stories?  :)

David

Subject:      Runner always wins?

I have been playing Netrunner for a while now. Myself and a friend play
mostly in pairs of games, swapping sides.

Well for quite some time only the corp has been winning. But last night we
played 4 games and the runner won every one. In one game the corp didn't
even score a single agenda!

I think this was because since the runner was always losing we have been
only working on the runner decks and not at all on the corp decks. Now we
will have to start work on the corp decks!

So, I my opinion, the corp does have an advantage but an experienced runner
(with a good deck) can tip the balance the other way.

Where in the HELL do you get that?!? <warning, flame alert>
Play it the way it's read? No, you're playing it the way you think it ought
to be! Maybe you need a few more (hundred) English lessons, but "elect" is
not an implied verb in the sentence "Runner cannot jack out".
"Runner cannot jack out" means <gasp> that the runner *can't* jack out. It
doesn't matter if the jacking out in question is voluntary or not! J-A
prevents it! Quit putting words on the card that don't exist, and maybe
you'll understand the rules a little better.

You are correct! Congratulations for making it half way through the rule
book. Now, read the card. The card says "even if not istalled *or rezzed*".=
=20

Hmm. What a problem. Rules say "not unless it's rezzed". Card says "even if
not rezzed". Fortunately the rules also state that "whenever cards conflict
with the rules, the cards take precedence". (pg 32 of the rulebook)
So now the situation is resolved. Virus test site affects the runner fully,
even if it's not rezzed. Simple. (and please pardon my partial flame here...
I'm still ticked off about the ignorance and stupidity of another person in
another debate)

Yes, but you'd still be rather silly to rez it. If you rez it, cards like
Speed Trap can be used.

Very true. So what exactly is your point?

>Damage only. =20

No. The "even if not installed or rezzed" part refers to the entire card.
The "if it has no counters" part is the *only* part that refers only to the
1 net damage.

I thought of the combination of Corporate Negotiating Center and
Corporate Downsizing, but it makes a very focused deck (with
a bunch of Systematics Layoffs - Hey! This could be the "Crisis,
what crisis?" deck I posted about a while ago.)
I have to agree that it could work and be very frustrating for
the runner.

        I actually have used CNC in decks, primarily because it
is so relentlessly good at gaining bits (3-4 bits a turn in the
midgame for no actions is pretty darn good in my opinion).  The
only problem, of course, is that you have to protect HQ REALLY
well.  However, there is an alternative: simply use the Agendas
in HQ (which you're showing every turn) as "bait" to keep the
'Runner away from your other dataforts.  After all, the selection
from HQ is random- it may take them several runs to grab the
right cards.

Subject:      Number of rares in your runner deck?

To Stephane and the world in general:
I'm not sure what you mean by not too many rares in a deck, its all
relative :) anyway, I have like 2 bartmoss,1 MFS,1 JOA,1 MIT - thats all
, 5 rares in my deck. (wouldn't mind a NETO)

my fast process corp is even cheaper to make. I have 3 rare ice that I
put in because I got them and it seems a shame not to use them :) but I can
replace them with any other ice. The deck is actually built around
commons/uncommons and 2 rares - AI CFO (need a 3rd). A total of 3 optional
+ 2 pretty important rares.

oh yeah, I have 2 roving submarines which aren't in my deck as they're not
that useful. Yes, I have actually beaten a Bloodcat/Roving
Submarine/Urban renewal etc deck by scoring political overthrow+tycho
extension (you can guess how many agenda he had in a 45 card deck)

Subject:      Tycho Extension vs Political Overthrow.

Main thing about Tycho Extension is that it can be scored in 1 turn
through fast process. Even with 2 project consultants, you can't score
political overthrow in 1 turn. Also, after you score Political overthrow,
you still have to score another agenda.. lets say its a 3/1 agenda. The
cost of scoring 1 tycho and 1 4/3 (or 3/3) is much less than scoring the
9/6 and 3/1.

If a corp deck needs to score only 2 agenda, vs 4 agenda, the deck design
is quite different as for the former, a "short term view" can be taken
when designing decks. There is no need to think about "slugging it out" with
Runner in Phase III because phase III will never happen.

p.s. around here the atmosphere is pretty relaxed since most of us are
     magic refugees :), like in magic, as here, we have no problems with
     playing "fun" decks.

pps  playing NR has really got to me. My latest t2 deck is a library
     management deck with loads of deck manipulation cards :) I can
     beat the dreaded turbo stasis but I lose to Thallid decks...

        When people put Political Overthrow in a deck, they put it in
almost exclusively to trim the Agenda percentage of their deck.  Most
decks with Political Overthrow never plan to score the darn thing anyway,
or to score it when they have such dominance over the game that the
'Runner can't do anything about an Agenda advanced over the course
of 3 turns.  Take a look at these two decks:
        Tycho Deck: 5 Tycho in a 50 card deck (10% of deck is Agendas)
        PO Deck: 3 Political Overthrow in a 45 card deck (6-7% of deck is
                Agendas)

        If the first action the 'Runner takes is to simply play
Custodial Position and run, then against the Tycho deck, he has around
a 28% chance to score an Agenda- against the Political Overthrow deck,
he has around a 19% chance to score an Agenda.  Considering that with
either of these decks, you have to score 2 Agenda to win (barring
some special use 'Runner cards), these odds start to build up rather
significantly.
        While most decks aren't "one Agenda" decks like the above,
the trimming effect remains much the same- it severely reduces the
odds that you will get nailed for a "cheapie" early in the game.

        It's not that Tycho Extension is bad, or Political Overthrow
good- just that they have very different uses.

Something about this just doesn't seem right, or maybe I'm missing something.  Wouldn't it be considered cheating to turn all of your cards so that the back faces one particular way?  I know that if I sat down at a tournament and saw my opponent doing this, I'd probably start to wonder.

I think it's because then if the runner sees a card come up upside down,
he or she potentially knows what card (or one of a few cards) it is.

   Ice subroutines are dealt with (either broken or not) in the order the
runner chooses. Then after it is determined what subroutines are broken
or not, the unbroken subroutines affect the runner in the order they are
listed on the ice card.
   For example: Black Dahlia encounters a Banpei. The runner has three
bits. The runner may choose to break the "End the run" subroutine,
leaving the "Trash a program" subroutine unbroken. Now that all the
subroutines are dealt with, the unbroken subroutines affect the runner,
in order. A program is trashed and, since the "end the run" subroutine is
broken, the ice is passed.

    As a side note: One of the best features of M:TG is the rule that
Upkeep costs *must* be addressed. We would do well to adopt this "must
address" ruling for ice subroutines, so that there is no argument about
forgetting to break a subroutine (or missing the text on the ice card).
Mastiff is particularly easy to make a mistake on.

We had three players the other night and we ended up working out a system in which each player plays two games simultaneously.  For instance, Player A played Runner against B and Corp against C, B played Corp against C's Runner and so on.  All play was standard and turn sequencing was controlled by issuing a "token" to each game.  The player would take his turn and then pass the token to his opponent in that game.  After the game finished, we talleyed the score and reversed the direction.

While it doesn't sound like much, it was pretty interesting to try to keep track of two games at once, not to mention scout the other decks on the table, knowing you'd face them next.  At any rate, it sould keep folks from getting left out when you have an extra player with nothing to do

From the FAQ:
Q: If the Corporation trashes three of the Runner's hardware cards with Power
Grid Overload, who chooses the order in which they hit the Runner's trash
pile?
A: The Corporation chooses. Any effects caused by the trashing of those cards
(for example, the Runner's having to trash programs due to reduced MU after
memory chips have been trashed) are handled only after all those cards are
trashed.

Not from the FAQ:
If you take multiple points of damage, though, take the discards one-at-a-time
to randomly determine the order in which they hit the graveyard.

I played a couple of good games against Zak Dolan down at BayCon in
San Jose while he was using a Roving Sub combination.  The one game
I remember he played Accounts Receivable then protected HQ and R&D
on turn 1.  Turn two he dropped an ice, Roving Sub, and another card
into a subsidiary fort.

Since he had 9 bits and I was low on cards without a Sentry breaker,
I didn't dare run on the fort.  On his next turn he rezzed Nevinyrral.
Blech.  4 actions per turn for the rest of the game and there's not a
thing I can do about it.

I think I beat him in that game, though.  His ice stalled badly and
I started roaming through R&D pretty much at will with Microtech
AI Interface and an R&D Interface.  Nasty combo.

>So... anyone have any good Roving Sub stories?  :)

Early in one game, we had 3 of our 4 pieces of agenda in HQ.
(2 Political Overthrows and a Corporate Retreat).  For safety,
we snuck an Overthrow on a Sub and waited awhile.  The
runner scored the other Overthrow but we got the Retreat.  A
little later we got our other retreat scored, so the only agenda
left was our PO on the Sub.  We had 3 more Project Consultants
left in the deck, so we weren't worried.  We collected bits,
toyed with the runner, and was generally smug with ourselves.
Eventually, we had plenty of bits and the two necessary
Consultants in HQ but we just sat and laughed at the runner's
feeble attempts to score the other point of agenda he needed.
Watching a frustrated runner bang his head against an R&D
with nothing he wants is very appealing.  We had nearly
exhausted our R&D prospects when the runner did something
unexpected.  He ran on R&D again and trashed one of our
multiple Whispering Campaigns.  Then he ran again and trashed
a Blood Cat we were trying to requisition.  To our horror, he
ran again, trashing the plans for our Remote Facility.  We looked
at R&D, knowing that there was only 1 card left.....The runner
saw this as well.  He ran again, nearly exhausting his bit pool
to make the final run.  Another Whispering Campagin showed
up and we glanced fearfully at the runner's available bits.....only
3 bits left....  So with a gleeful chuckle, we started our turn,
drew our last card from R&D, and scored our Political
Overthrow.

Final score:  Corp 12 agenda points, Runner 6.

I know what you mean about rare ice.
It's a shame that most of it is so good (apart from Cortical Scanner which
really makes me fear Tinweasel :) I can't refrain from using it either.
As to the number of rare cards I use, it's usually around 5-7 too. When I make
"stronger" decks, I build two matched decks and give one to my opponent
(assuming he's not richer/more addicted than me :)

Maybe I'm just stupid, but don't traps supress late runs even more? I mean,
unless your deck is primarily a trap deck, the chances of me hitting a trap
early in the game aren't great. Later in the game, my chance of hitting a
trap increases, because they could now also be in subsidiary data forts.

Everybody has bad luck, and I'm probably not the *best* runner in the
world... just second or third :-)
So I think you have a chance of winning. Not a great chance, though ;)

I would credit the "alternative interpretations" to the following
posts...

*** Dated: 29-Apr-96 on NETRUNNER-L
Virus Test Site will do damage if the runner accesses it anywhere except
the achives.  If the runner pulls the card from the top of R&D, from HQ
or from a subsidary data fort before the corp has put any advancement
counters on it he will take 1 net damage.

In order to do more than 1 net damage the corporation needs to install
and advance the card.  The Test Site will do 2 net damage for every
advancement counter on it when the runner accesses it, but only if the
card has been rezzed.  If the corp does not rez the Test Site it will
still only do 1 net damage, no matter how many advancement counters are
on it when accessed.

Virus Test Site has a rez cost of zero, but yes, you do have to rez the
card in order to do the extra damage to the runner.  If you don't rez
the
card the runner only takes 1 net damage, not 8(2 for each of the
advancement counters).

This reminds me of my 88 card "Zombie" deck I play in M:TOG It is huge
(103 including sideboard) and made of Zombies and some support. Everyone
looks at it and says it cant win so I offer to play them in Ante I crush
them they dont understand. I have played this deck for 2+ years and have
an 81% win ratio people still say it cant win it does why because I
understand How to play the deck If I switch decks with them I usually
win again with their deck "HMM" they say, "see it cant win you must just
have been lucky." but they wont play it again in ANTE. Maybe we should
start playing NR with an ANTE system see if you want to back up your
JOA/MFS combo. (by the way I do play ANTE NR you ante UP a card from
each of your decks one at the start of each round the winner by points
takes both cards)

That is *so* clever. :D

Before I go running to start using this combination myself, doesn't MBD say,
"one of *your* programs to the trash"? If a program hasn't been installed

certainly, however, you are in the minority. The majority of people who
read newsgroups, mailing lists, etc. are more than happy to copy
something that someone else said worked. If someone posts their
unbeatable runner deck, chances are that very quickly other people will
start to play that killer runner deck.

I'm going to make my own decks also. I believe part of this game (and any
ccg) is player creativity. Lots of other people just want to win.

i dunno about the CNC, however, what is so obvious about why you wouldn't
use a wall of ice.

Personally, i like it. It goes well in wall decks. It's a good deal
compared to a liche.

liche: 4 subroutines, strength 6, total damage: 3 brain
wall of ice: 4 subroutines, strength, total damage: 4 net

net damage is only slightly easier to prevent than brain damage, the wall
of ice is twice as likely to end the run, and against an unprotected
runner, the wall of ice is more likely to flatline them than the liche.
Against multiple runs the brain damage can stack up.

plus it costs less to rez.

what's so obvious about not using it?

No but if you put a dollar in the machine then push the button to get

Kewl I will just put a Trap into my deck then If I lose I will turn it
180 degrees and call a judge over after the match.

By the way this is sarcasm and in no way meant to imply I would really
do this but remember if you lose in a tourney try to be at least grown
up about it to accept what happens (even if you later found out about
cheating) I have lost three different tourney to cheaters and 22 to non
cheating and you know what it doesnt really matter to me. I am not in
the game to make money I am in it to have fun. If I lose to someone and
later find out he/she is cheating I KNOW I won and I feel good when I
lose to non cheating I know I had a good game and that is all that I
care about. (BTW I have also won 4 tourneys)(BTOW none of these tourneys
are NR they were all M:TOG)

Umn magic has another rulling that says if it is only Destroyed to do

Hey Sparky. Can you explain to me how this ruling is a 'simple'
interpertation of the rules? What is written in the rules that
indicates that WotC has to 'rule' that prevention of the trashing
do not prevent the effect of getting bits?

since when does trashing ZMC prevent you from trashing the installed
programs if I have 7 MU worth of programs And my ZMC is trashed I must
trash 3 programs to get back to my 4 MU max (true I do get to choose the
programs and if I have only 5 MU installed I only need to trash one) But
Really to answer your question for many decks the ability to get the
Deamon out with short circuit is much more powerfull than hoping to draw
that ZMC (some deck designs don't however need that type of speed) it
really depends on your deck design.

What do you mean does it still affect the agenda. If you mean can I as
runner simply trash the BES and take the agenda the answer is no you
cannot.

Actually, that's still me.  (zonker@westworld.com, billing@westworld.com)

I do the billing and accounting at Westworld, and forgot to change the
address after checking my business mail.  At least it's better than my old
P.P.H. handle of Tholarion.  And don't ask what P.P.H. stands for.  Worst
damn acronym I've ever heard in my life...

Come on, Zonker in the comics goes by "Z" sometimes!  Why can't I?  Just as

Subject:      Corp Negotiating Center.

ObNR: I could only find two cards that I wouldn't use (yet!) in
a corp deck: Wall of Ice (for obvious reasons) and Corporate
Negotiating Center. Does someone use CNC here?
I don't have the guts.

As a matter of fact, it was in my tournament corp deck.  It's for
basically 3 things:

1. Something you can install face down (90% of my money is like that
also)

2. For 'clutch' bits (Corp war+systematic layoffs for example).

3. To taunt the runner into coming for HQ where I have a Trap or two
waiting for him.

Yes, it takes balls to play.

Well, a question i have already asked and got no answer to is:
If the runner leaves the BES in the node and runs again, is he
affected or not ? on the card it reads "this does not affect
further run" and i had always read that for when the cards is
trashed, but a friend of mine argued with me and said it was no
further run, even if it's not trashed...

So, anyone ?

Good points all around.  Unfortunately, the unoriginality is not what I'm
most concerned about.  What I'm concerned about are all of the losers out
there with the attitude of "If the rules don't SPECIFICALY say that I can't,
then I can."

I've ended up in fights before over such situations.  Netrunner was supposed
to have relatively airtight rules, but human nature has proved it wrong.

Could I put JOA/MFS in my runner deck if I wanted?  Yes, I could put TWO of
each in.  Do I?  No.  Why not?  Because it's illegal, and NOBODY will EVER
convince me otherwise.

Subject:      Ideal situations (bit value: 0)

Bit value: 0 (random musing)

The great chess teacher C.J.S. Purdy recommended in the course of planning
at chess that the player ask himself, "if I had two moves in a row, what
would I do?" The idea was that the player released himself from the
inhibiting thought process, "I go there, he goes there, I go there," and
who knows? -- maybe the opponent will waste a move.

I have tried to adapt that kind of thinking to NetRunner deck construction
by asking, "what is the absolute best situation for this card to be played
in?", forgetting for a moment that NetRunner and chess are not played in
vacuums and that the hideous opponents are always there trying to muck us
up.

For instance, Synchronized Attack on HQ is best when the corporation is
bitless. Therefore, ideally, we would like to play a Priority Wreck to run
on HQ, then make him spend a bunch of bits, and *then* Synchro Attack him.
So, gain a bunch yourself before Priority Wrecking, but not by using Joan
and misc. :) Playful AI for a couple dozen, then Priority Wreck, then
Synchro Attack.

Hey, like I said, we're just dreaming here. :)

I was contemplating virii earlier, and it seems to me that a Bodyweight
Data Creche, Karl deVeres, and a Wilson Doofusweefle work great with
Incubator. (I repeat that in this dream state we don't care about Chance
Observations.) Take four actions, then run the archives with Wilson. Hit
'im with an incubate counter, and earn a bit. Creche run, another incubate,
another bit. Eventually, when you eventually infect the corporation with a
destructive virust (Cascade/Skiviss/what have you), you'll be rolling for
who-knows-how-many incubators.

Sorry, Zonker, but from page 31 of the rulebook:
"If you prevent all damage from an effect that causes damage, you
are considered not to have been damaged at all by that effect."

Now, what I'm wondering is why didn't they extend that restriction
to ALL effects? Then JoA/MfS would not work. But they didn't.

Subject:      Breaker pairs

Ok, today's topic is breaker pairs:

The definition is '2 breakers, that when available together in a deck,
should cover the spectrum of ice encountered so as to break them
efficiently.'

Example 1: Worm and Ramming piston.  Worm deals efficiently with walls
with strength <2, and Ramming piston deals with the rest of them.

Example 2: Black Deliah and Shakka. Black deals with expensive ice
(relatively cheaply), while Shakka deals with the lesser ice fairly
efficiently.

Other combos such as shakka/flak are also valid.  Which ones work well
for you?

We for the most part will agree with you that the combo has not affected
tournament play in the extreme.  What we ARE concerned with is a ruling on
whether such a combo was ever intended to be allowed.

Since it seems that you can choose whether or not to use a Force Shield,
choosing to use it to prevent damage is the same as choosing to use Joan to
prevent trashing.  Therefore, using Lifesaver Nanosurgeons after preventing
damage should work, if one is using the very same illogic that spawned JOA/MFS.

What we really want, instead of a specific ruling on a single combo, are
rulings on exactly how prevention works, EXACTLY why certain after-effects
of prevention are legal or illegal, and exactly what "trashing" refers to.
Is trashing similar to sacrifice, destruction, or burial from Magic, or does
it refer to something else entirely?  Thus far, trashing seems to be
anything anyone wants it to be, and that's wrong.

If the rules team can't resolve, or at least discuss important issues such
as these, there probably shouldn't be a rules team.  DO NOT take this to
mean that I think Proteus should go on the back burner.  Proteus should
certainly be #1.

I have seen a lot of people explaining the text as:
It does 2 net damage per advancement counter.
Or it does 1 net damage if it has no counters, even if it is not installed
or rezzed.

But, you are Sparky so must be right. Your explanation is even better. I now

Well, it is clear that Nanosurgeons takes place *after* the damage is
prevented.  You were not damaged.

With MFS one could argue that the effects happen simultaneously -- the
cards are trashed and you get the bits.  Immediately afterwards, you
prevent the trashing (during the prevention phase), and the programs
remain untrashed.

If MFS said gain 3 bits for each prgram that was trashed last action or last turn,
then it would be more parallel to Lifesaver Nanosurgeons.

I think that the rules team has ruled on this, and that your flame and

Two n's, and yes I'm a game designer.  I didn't actually work on
Netrunner (I was working on Armed & Dangerous at the time), but
I did work on Proteus and am now .... !@((@$$( [transmission
interrupted]

But sorry, can't pin that one on me.  I never used the word "elect"
in my posts on this subject.

"Try" and "choose", yes, but not "elect".  :-)

Jack Attack doesn't prevent the Runner from *trying* to jack out,
it prevents the Runner from *succeeding*.

Submarine Uplink forces the Runner to try to jack out.  No, the
card doesn't have the words "try to" on it, they are implied.  Jack
Attack makes the result (in this case, successfully jacking out)
impossible, so the Runner's attempt fails.

Note that if Submarine Uplink was worded differently, Jack
Attack would not prevent it from working.  If it said "Submarine
Uplink jacks you out" then it would not be the Runner making
the attempt and so Jack Attack would not prevent the attempt
from succeeding.

Further runs are not affected by BES once it's trashed, but if
it isn't, it still does affect the *current* run. You must trash it
if you want to run again this turn and get the agenda.

It sounds interesting (if you have a large triangular table).
But wasn't it a bit slow?

If not this could be a great way to handle an uneven number of players.

And Richard Cripe replied:
================================
Early in one game, we had 3 of our 4 pieces of agenda in HQ.
(2 Political Overthrows and a Corporate Retreat).  For safety,
we snuck an Overthrow on a Sub and waited awhile.  The
runner scored the other Overthrow but we got the Retreat.  A
little later we got our other retreat scored, so the only agenda
left was our PO on the Sub.  We had 3 more Project Consultants
left in the deck, so we weren't worried.  We collected bits,
toyed with the runner, and was generally smug with ourselves.
Eventually, we had plenty of bits and the two necessary
Consultants in HQ but we just sat and laughed at the runner's
feeble attempts to score the other point of agenda he needed.
Watching a frustrated runner bang his head against an R&D
with nothing he wants is very appealing.  We had nearly
exhausted our R&D prospects when the runner did something
unexpected.  He ran on R&D again and trashed one of our
multiple Whispering Campaigns.  Then he ran again and trashed
a Blood Cat we were trying to requisition.  To our horror, he
ran again, trashing the plans for our Remote Facility.  We looked
at R&D, knowing that there was only 1 card left.....The runner
saw this as well.  He ran again, nearly exhausting his bit pool
to make the final run.  Another Whispering Campagin showed
up and we glanced fearfully at the runner's available bits.....only
3 bits left....  So with a gleeful chuckle, we started our turn,
drew our last card from R&D, and scored our Political
Overthrow.

Final score:  Corp 12 agenda points, Runner 6.

 Huh! Well, that makes me look at the card in a completely different light.
However, I have a question. Doesn't this basically make Speed Trap a
useless card against ambush nodes, since most of them have that
phrase on there?

My friends and I always seem to get a big kick out of pulling a large number
of cards from the runners' hand at once.
Well, we could always shuffle them (though shuffling two cards requires an
expertise I don't have).

I never use Access to Orbital. Even if it's very cheap to install, it's
too expensive in the long run.
Arasaka and Kiribati are my links of choice, with a Sprinboard for
rough times.
When I have a deck that uses a lot of bits, I may fall back on Submarine
Uplink.
Unfortunately, I never seem to have the MU for Bakdoor.

That's mostly how I build my decks too.
Then comes the paranoia and I add cards to protect my "great moves" from
being spoiled.
In the second part, it's useful to take the opposite point of view, i.e. what
is the worst thing that could happen to me if I wanted to use these cards?
It works if your paranoid - I mean - perceptive enough.

Note that Mr. Varghas said that the runner run again to get the

When you encounter a piece of ice ther is two phases:

  1. You break subroutines in any order you want, using any icebrakers
     you want.

  2. Any subroutines left unbroken happen to you in the order written
     on the card.

Hope this helps.

I don't think so. CNC gives you the opportunity to gain bits. Two or

Maybe I suffered to much brain damage,but do we have here two
different official rulings about Virus Test Site ?!

First I thought that I do not need to rez VTS ( with let me assume 3
advancment counters on it ) to do 6 damage to the runner.Then I was
told that I read the card in the wrong way.Ok.My bad english I thought
- so I have to rez it.
Now we have two official statements:

1.you must not rez the card to do,staying in the above example,6
damage.
2.You have to rez it to do 6 damage.

Is it possible to post the definte ruling of this card.

Wait a moment,.....Ok.Back with the card and reread it (how often I
did this now <g>

Actually, he IS wrong.  Show me why all you want, your analysis is
incorrect, although I do see where confusion could crop up.  The wording on
the card itself is the most prominent reason why it must be rezzed for the
tokens to damage the runner.  Any who read it differently need a writing
class.

And again, who cares about Speed Trap?  Ambush nodes never surprise a runner
anyway.  I transfer the tokens over with Falsified Transactions Expert.  If
you use Speed Trap and jack out, you're doing me a big favor.

Live with it.  If you are tired of arguments, don't start them.  If you
recollect, this argument started with someone who asked a question, and gave
his own opinion on the answer, which was correct.  Only when someone decided
to butt in and provide an incorrect solution did the argument begin.

In a nutshell, stop calling the kettle black, pot.

Now do you know why there's a Newsgroup Taunting card?  :)

In that case, having a judge that sees every card the runner accesses will
be necessary.  I find it appalling that my deck idea could conceivably

Sorry, not true.  Nanosurgeons say "if you take damage", and because of
Force Shield you don't take damage.  Joan of Arc prevents trashing, but
Misc. doesn't give bits for what cards are trashed, but what cards were
attempted to be trashed.  Programs going to trash isin't a cost of M-F-S,
but taking damage has to happen (can't be prevented) if you want to draw
cards.

I should clear this up now before everyone mail me about it.  I wasn't thinking
when I replied to this.  My brain was thinking 90 degrees, while my fingera
typed 180 degrees.  My point about the 180 degree card never coming up is if
you are pressed for time or just miss the card while going through your stack
at end of the game.  It is a good idea, and I think it will almost always work
(if the situation comes up) but I HAD to point out the flaws.

The rules team already *has* resolved the issue, you just don't like
the answer.  The current ruling is correct according to the current
rules no matter how many times you try to argue against it.  We will
not change the current ruling because it *is* correct according to
the current rules.

Arguing that the current ruling is wrong gets you nowhere.  In fact,
I'd have to say that it hurts your chances of being listened to in the
future.

Arguing for or against a particular wording change is fine, because
it helps us make sure that we *fix* the cards if we do decide to
reword them.  Pointing out wordings that are unclear or confusing
is also great - it helps us make the game better.

Saying that the rules team shouldn't exist is equally detrimental to
your reputation in our eyes.  Eventually we'll just stop reading your
posts because from our point of view there's no reason to answer
your questions.  You're not going to listen anyway, so why bother?

So... the rules team is considering alternate wordings for both of the
cards and the possible side effects of those new wordings.  If you want
to help, suggest alternate wordings and note the possible side effects
that they might have.  A couple of people have made suggestions, and
we have those cataloged.

We *might* change one or both of the cards which *might* make
the current ruling irrelevant.  *If* we change the cards, we may or
may not issue errata for the v1.0 versions of the cards.  If we do not
issue errata for them, however, they will continue to be played
according to the current ruling.

None of *us* are particularly thrilled that there is a degenerate
combo in Netrunner, either, but we're not going to go off willy-nilly
and change rules, rulings, and/or cards just to fix one combo.  WotC
has tried that before, and I think you're familiar with the results.

strip wich appears in all the conservative and right wing papers called
DOONESBURY it includes a character named Zonker who if memory serves
correctly was once an olympic level "tanner" as in he sunbathed for
competition. He also was into many of the '70's hippie things and now is
a guilty yuppie.

I'm one of the anal-retentive types who _always_ keeps my cards facing the same

cheating, it's news to me.

  If I  was playing you I would take the damage.  IMO, the Node will
damage the runner because He can't jack out before it takes effect
because you haven't/can't REZZ it.

  Send me the JOA card and I'll put it in my deck, along with the
misc.for-sale(I have that one), and I'll get back to you with the
response.  :)  I have the Backup Drive and the misc.for-sale in my deck.
I have the Back up Drive in case the corp decides to trash a much needed
program.  I have the misc.for-sale in my deck for desperate bits.  I
wouldn't actually trash needed programs, but I would trash programs in my
Daemons, if I need bits more than the use of the programs.

  I didn't say anything about Richmond, VA,  I said,"My friends told me
there was a lot of cheating going on at the Tourney." Now, how do you or
I know if the people doing it were from VA or not?  Hmm?

  Do you have a guilty conscience?

It's a rare card, like most of the cards that have a very specialized use.

That's reason enough, innit?
And now that I've seen the description of what it does, yes I did put my one
CNC in my corp deck. I've only gotten it out once, and the runner trashed
it! I was really amazed. I thought that would be one node the runner
wouldn't mind...

I does exist, but not in France. The French government but up a big stink
over this card, so WotC just altered the distributions in such a way that no

Ice, but I think my friend would notice it missing....

Excuse me, but how do you propose to "prevent" something that's already

Well, I'll be going now, before I get re-embroiled in this arguement, loose

Gain 3 bits for each program trashed. If you prevented the trashing, no
programs were trashed. If the programs are already trashed, then it's too
late to prevent the trashing.

Hmm.But on page 32 of the rule book you can read:

The effects of cards are cumulative,as applicable,unless the cards
specify otherwise.

Are you sure.I have all ambush cards and can not find on most of them
this phrase.Definetely I found it only on VTS.

On some cards you will find the phrase: ...even if not installed
(Trap!,...) but nothing about that you do not have to rez them to
effect the runner.So if such a card,like Trap!,is installed in a SDF
you have to rez it before the runner accesses it to effect him.
After the corp rez this card you can use Speed Trap to jack out.

If the runner accesses Trap! from R&d or HQ you can not use Speed Trap
of course,because you cannot rez cards in R&D or HQ.

        Well, I'd like to voice a request that you institute a general
policy of "most current wording" on cards- that is, whether or not
specifically stated, the latest version of a card has the official
wording and errata applied to it, and all older versions must follow
it.  It ends up being a LOT simpler in the long run, and avoids much
confusion as people try and figure out what errata applies to what
versions of a card (more to the point, it ensures all cards function
in a consistent manner).

        Gosh darn it! It's *not* degenerate.  Misc.For-Sale can serve
as a good source of late-game bits.  It functions that way WITH or
WITHOUT Joan of Arc.  In a good deck, you're unlikely to have the
50-60 Imps that make it a truly disgusting engine... if you do, you'll
lose the game far before you ever draw the Misc.For-Sale or the Joan
of Arc.  Let's face it- in the late game, you're ALWAYS going to have
a pile of stuff you can safely trash, provided you think you're going
to win soon.  Whether or not you prevent these things from going to
the trash generally ends up being irrelevant, as they weren't terribly
useful to begin with.

        Of the 11 Ambushes in the game, 1 (VTS) is useable while not
rezzed, and 2 more are useable from HQ/R&D.  The rest must be both
installed and rezzed to use (which might be why you don't see them
that much).  Note that all of the really nasty ones are like this
(Vacant Soulkiller, Experimental AI).

        Much as I hate to disagree with the downtrodden souls who have
yet to acquire a Wall of Ice (hell... if you're that desperate I'll
send you one- I've got like 7 of the useless things), look at CNC:

Corporate Negotiating Center     0 3 Node-Asset
     At the start of each of your turns, gain 1* for each [agenda] card stored
     in HQ that you show to Runner.
     "That which does not get me fired makes me more valuable to the
     corporation- Dave Michaels, Microtech Special Ops"
     (Roger Coad)

        Since you have have multiple "start of turn" effects, you can
simply keep showing the 'Runner Agendas in your hand to gain bits with
multiple CNC's out (just as if you multiple Braindance Campaign out,
you would get to use them all).  BTW: Another reason to love CNC is
the fact that it has a rez cost of 0 and a trash cost of 3...

And I reply:
Yes, I believe you would gain the bits.  The trashing is not prevented,
so I would presume that the cards are trashed but you were fortunate

Subject:      Shields

Is the effect offered by a Shield/Force Shield/Whatever optional?

For example,  I am looking at the last card in my hand and wondering why
on earth I put the card into my deck in the first place.  I have
Lifesaver Nano-Surgeons installed as well as a Force Shield.  Can I
willingly take the next point of net damage I encounter, even when the
FS could prevent it, so that I can then use LN to get the cool cards
that I know must be around somewhere more quickly?

In effect, does the Runner call up the shield when needed, or is it an
active background program automatically preventing any damage it can?

Unfortunately I am not gifted with powers of telepathy and am unable to read the

   Well, if noone else will, then I'll give it a try... :)
   It *seems* clear to me that as long as the BES is being accessed its
ability is in effect (first line). Therefore the last line may only be of
interest if the BES has been trashed previously. If the runner accesses the
fort a second time after trashing the BES on the first run, then the
agenda is liberated. If, however, the BES is still in play, then it is
accessed again and the agenda is not liberated.

    Other interpretations? Comments? Derisions? Deleted expletives?

   If you are referring to Submarine Uplink, remember that it is not an
icebreaker and therefore cannot be used until after the first subroutine
affects the runner. In this case the "blanket prohibition" "cannot jack
out" takes precedence over "must jack out" according to the netrep.
   If you are referring to Dropp(TM), remember that Dropp(TM) uses the
phrase "end your run" as opposed to "jack out."  Using Dropp(TM) is *not*
jacking out and therefore Jack Attack's first SR does not prohibit its
effect.
   To the best of my knowledge, there are no icebreakers that require the
runner to "jack out."

   I tried using the JOA/MFS for the first time yesterday, in a fun game
of "Corporate War" (which is what we call "Keep it simple"). The costs in
actions to make the durn combo work are ridiculous. I got my Corp (I was
the runner) lotsa bits, but I ran thrice after the initial rush before the
game was was over and I was using Blink. Between the lengthy setup and the
costs in actions to reset (reinstall JOA; Junkyard the MFS), I don't see this
as a effective combo in one-on-one play. Let's not forget that in order to
Junkyard the MFS, you have to be really careful about drawing cards. The
discard comes after the runner has finished all actions. I will happily play
anyone who wants to use the combo against me; the game'll be over before
he/she gets the combo effectively set up and long before all dem bits can be
used...

   This ain't a Channel/Fireball situation, folks...

   Noone at my tournament in Saskatoon tried it. There was, however, the
beginnings of a positively *evil* ice destruction deck... *shudder*

Well, obviously you can't.  In the case of the Runner, no matter how
good/degenerate your deck is, you simply cannot win in 3 turns if the
Corp has not shuffled 7 points of Agenda to the top quarter of his deck.

Similarly, when you play a Speed Corp deck, you could easily get a bad
shuffle (since you only start with 5 cards, it's very easy to get shafted
by a bad draw).  You won't be winning in 3 turns unless you get a very
good mix of Agendas (at least 7 points worth), Fast Advancements, and Ice.

A Tag 'n Bag deck should be able to do it within 3 turns...once.  The
second time a Runner plays against this deck, he'll probably take his
time to build up some defense against being Bagged before he runs.  Of
course, in a tournament situation, it'll be way too late to change your
tactics when your opponent moves on to the next round and you go home.

So, "winning in 3 turns" is an unreasonable test for degenerateness in
this game (actually, I can't think of any game where a player can build
a deck that CONSISTANTLY wins in 3 turns).  And, it also depends on what
you mean by "CONSISTANTLY".  99% of the time?  75%?  55%?

Reading the digest this morning I found a couple of mails which jump out at

Erm, I don't think so :-

"Whenever one or more INSTALLED programs are being sent to the trash
at the same time, you may instead choose to put any or all of the
programs on top of Microtech Backup Drive in any order you choose.
If Backup Drive is removed from play, trash any cards on it.
(A): Bring the top card on Backup Drive into your hand."

A card in your hand is not installed!


>   Oh. This guy won the small tournament I ran in Saskatoon last Sunday.

I really do hope he didn't win by cheating in this way.

2)
There seems to be a lot of discussion about whether Dropp will "end the
run" after a jack attack has stopped the runner "jacking out".
That's just it look at what I have just written. They are two different
things. Ending the run can occur at any time. Jacking out is the choice
the runner has before approaching the next piece of ice. Dropp ends the run
which is defined in the FAQ :-

"Q: When does Dropp(TM) end the run?

A: Dropp(TM) ends the run after the Runner finishes the piece of ice he or
she was encountering when it was used. Future editions of Dropp(TM) will
have the following word change to clarify: "<Picture: 0>: Break all
subroutines on a piece of ice and end your run." "

This is before the runner gets chance to jack out, so is a different thing!


I hope this is all correct and if he could be so kind could Sparky confirm
it.

How about this. You decide to go wash your car.  After you wash your
car, in celebration of its being clean, you will buy yourself an ice
cream -- heck, you'll give yourself an ice cream for each car you
wash.  So you go and wash your car, and because you're hungry, your
neighbor's car as well.  Unfortunately, you're also lazy.  So you take
the cars to the car wash place, and send them in.

In celebration for having washed the cars, you go to 31 Flavors and
buy yourself two cones of ice cream.

Meanwhile, your mean landlady Joan, who hates cleanliness of any sort,
sneaks in to the car wash and disables the machine, preventing the cars
from being washed.  You come out, happily finishing off the last of the
Mocha Almond Fudge you got in a huge waffle cone, only to find that,
tragically, that the cars are not, in fact, washed.

Yet this strange thing has happened.  You told yourself, honestly,
that you would give yourself a cone for each car you washed.  And you
did in fact wash the car -- how were you supposed to know that Joan
would maliciously and cruelly prevent your car from being washed, for
no good reason that you can see.  And, of course, it's much too late
to give the ice cream back.  What do you do?

Wow, I almost feel sorry for that poor Misc.For-Sale.

Thanks,
Dave

Thank you for your rational answer to my off the cuff irrational
question. I really don't know why I asked it except that in my over
excuburent(sp?) hope of finding some way to prove that Submarine Uplink
should force the jack out even after you hit a Jack attack (or even if
you hit a Pocket virtual reality right after hitting a Shock.r I think
you should be forced to jack out after the trace attempts).

In M:TOG if you can win in 3 turns 1 out of every 10 games it is
considered consistant and degenerate.

I consistantly win my OG in under 7 turns one out of every 4 games and I
am considered slow.

In NR I have rarely seen other than a lucky win anybody win in under 10
turns. I have never seen a game last longer than 23 turns (with the
possible exception of that submarine story about the political overthrow
deck) I have never heard of a corp losing by running out of cards. This
indicates to me that most games are between 7 to 25 turns in length the
possibility of scoring usable bits with JOA/MFS usually exists around
turn 14 or so this is which places it right in the middle of this
average (ok a little to the low side) this seems like a mildly pleasent
(for the runner) situation but hardly degenerate. Especially when as you
so eloquently put it the only turn 3 wins even remotely likely to be
consistant are CORP tag-n-slag decks. The only possible degenerate decks
seem to me to be these CORP types. Therefore if the runner has some toy
like JOA/MFS that has a possibity of exploiting a slow corp deck (like
most tag-n-slag are) it seems that it only counters out the degeneracy
of that deck. JOA/MFS is too slow to be of use against a speed processer
(baring a bad draw on the corps part) so if you base your deck around it
you will lose to some but beat others if you base your deck around speed
you will lose to t-n-s and beat the speed processors. Throwing in a MFS
just because it is a good card and might combo with your JOA in your
speed deck is not degenerate it is just using the cards to have a deck
that might be able to handle both types but now you have diluted the
original purpose of the deck. It is a no win situation you must try to
balance precariously and just PLAY THE DANG thing however it is built
the rules are well written with a few minor glitches this is not one of
them however and the Rules team RULES they have done a great job in
timely answering what few questions came up. and the fact that there are
so few questions (just the same ones repeated endlessly) is a testament
to the overall quality of this game.

To sum it up I dont think there are any degenerate combos in this game
there are some combos that if they come up really suck for one side or
the other (like trojan horse urban renewal and JOA/MFS) but both sides
have ways to handle it (like Fall guy and Chimera) So quit whinning and
start playing maybe you will find the one truly degenerate combo (the
one I will not share with anyone no matter what you try even if you send
me a wall of ice and Stephane Bura's  twin sisters home address)

Please stop with this mental masturbation.  You can dream up all the sophistic
explanations you want. One fact will still remain. JOA/MFS is legal only because
wizards say that it is. If it wasn't for the specific ruling, I'd never let my
opponent get away with it nor would I use it myself. However the ruling is
there. That should settle all the arguments. Lets move on.

Hmm.. I think it probably depends on the decks, but 7 to 25 seems about
right.  I think I've seen some games go to 30 and rarely a game to
35, but that's because my corp decks suck.  :)

In terms of JOA/MFS though, the deck I'm tinkering with now usually
gets about 12-20 bits on turn 2 or 3.  (Number of bits correlates to
which turn.)  Still, doing that and playing against my friend's black
speed war deck it still went 1 and 1 (ie 1 win and 1 loss).  I've
changed a couple cards around though... If I can get it to
consistantly win, I'll submit it to Sparky.  (I'd play it in a
tournament, but Wizard's doesn't have any plans for one around the San
Francisco Bay Area anytime soon as far as I know (where's Pacificon

I believe he was being sarcastic. In fact it was a double sarcasm (if there is
such a thing). This cartoon is extremely liberal (bleeding heart liberal is the
technical term). And there is no such thing as right wing/conservative papers
here since our press is mostly bleeding heart liberal as well.

To stay on topic:
The world of netrunner or cp2020 would probably be the result of conservative
policies -- deregulation, pro big business.

On the other hand liberals would probably drive us to the "happy-happy, joy-joy"
future a la "Demolition Man".

Pick your poison.

JOA/MFS, and Lifesaver Nanosurgeons at the rules team meeting
this morning.

Here are your answers:

All of these changes will take place in v2.0.  Treat them as errata to
your v1.0 cards.

misc.for-sale will read "successfully trashed" instead of "trashed."
You can no longer get the bits for misc.for-sale if you use Joan of Arc.

Lifesaver Nanosurgeons will read "successfully damaged" instead of
"damaged."  This makes Lifesaver Nanosurgeons read better - the way it
has always worked.

Submarine Uplink will read "ends your run" instead of "forces you to
jack out."  This ends the ambiguity over its interaction with Jack
Attack.



FYI:  I have over 100 unread messages from Netrunner-L.  I'm going to
delete any messages with subjects dealing with these cards, since I
think I've just answered all your concerns.  If you have an issue you
feel is unanswered, please re-post it or mail it directly to me at

Subject:      Peeking at Trash/Archives

What are the rules for looking through the trash and archives.
Can the Corp look through the Runner's Trash pile at any time?
Can the Runner look through the Corp's faceup Archives at any time
or only after a successful Archives run?

The latter case came up recently when the Corp used Off-Site Backups
to grab a card out of Archives, and I wanted to check Archives to
see which card had disappeared.

Well, you won't get a first-hand account from me. My group hasn't seen
a misc.for.sale card yet in 7 starter decks and 2 1/2 boxes worth of
boosters, and I can't imagine that any of my friends would
interpret the English language the way WotC seems to have; so we're
not likely to build such a deck should one of us get the card combo.

Late in the game, a runner will almost invariably have at least a couple of
Force Shields out, which counteract Trap! and Setup! cards very well.  Also,
if I place them in subsidiary forts, my HQ is suddenly less protected.  All
I really want is to keep the runner out until I can get set up a bit.

Bravo to all included in these decisions! And now that I see the
wordings, I actually understand the confusion behind the issues.
The "successfully" makes all the difference in the world. Although,
I have to admit that given the way things are currently worded, the
decisions about Lifesaver Nanosurgeons and misc.for-sale should
have been consistent...

But, that's hindsight, so yay for no broken combos and yay for new
discussion topics!

    Hats off to the rules team!
    Everything starts to make sense. You don't get the money if you don't
actually sell stuff.  Nanosurgeons can't repair the damage that was not done.
And you automatically loose your connection to the net if your relay station
submerges.
    Common sense finally prevails. If only it worked this way in the real world.

Do us a favor and stop mentioning Magic.  Magic rules are not Netrunner
rules.  Besides, there are at least 3 other ways for a card to be removed
from play that DO NOT allow the effect to still happen.

Please forgive me if this has already been answered, but I didn't see it in the FAQ (watch, someone will point to it and say: "Right there, line 34, dope!") and need a ruling on the following.

The runner has Crash Everett out and the Corp plays City Surveillance.  The runner draws one card and then takes the second as Crash says.  Does the runner have to pay a bit or gain a tag for both cards?  Is using  Crash optional?

I got busted up hard by this last night, so I just gotta know.

Without an Access Through Alpha, you can get completely wiped out by a Blood

The misc.for-sale errata was just posted.  The Shell Traders decisions were=

made long ago, and I don't see them changing.  Here's my file of errata,
interpretations, and rulings for Shell Traders:

Original Wording:
A: Choose a program or hardware card from your hand. Set that card aside, a=

last Shell counter on that card has been removed, install that card, at no =

[1]: Remove one Shell counter from a card.

Errata:

put a number of Shell counters on it equal to its installation cost. When t=
he =

last Shell counter on that card has been removed, install that card, at no =

cost. =

[1]: Remove one Shell counter from a card.
Remove one Shell counter from one card at the start of each of your turns.

Interpretations/Rulings:
* Card is set aside face-up so Corp can verify the number of Shell counters=
 =

placed on it.

* Each copy can remove 1 counter from any card that has them.

* If Shell Traders is removed from play, any cards with Shell counters on =

them remain =8Cin limbo=B9 and can have their counters removed by subsequen=
t =

copies of Shell Traders.

* "At no cost" means the regular bit cost of a card.  If a card states that=
 =

it has additional installation costs, you must pay them.  If another card =

indicates that additional costs must be paid to install the card being =

processed by Shell Traders, you must pay that cost.

* If you remove the last counter from a program and don't have any free MU,=
 =

you MUST overwrite an existing program.

* If you remove the last counter from a card that has additional costs to =

install and you have those resources, you MUST spend them and install the c=

* If you CANNOT pay the additional costs, you lose the opportunity to insta=

that card, and it slips into limbo permanently; remove it from the game.

Very simply - that's the way the card is worded. =


"*For the remainder of the run, Runner must pay [2] when encountering a pie=
ce =

of ice, in addition to any other costs, or end the run."

Now if the card read "...Runner must pay [2] when _approaching_ a piece of =

ice..." that would be a different story.  However, encountering ice happens=
 =

after the Corp has had a chance to rez it.  It's a good card for stopping =

the Runner, but isn't good in a Black Ice deck.  Not all cards can be =

everything to everyone.

There are no 'problems' being avoided here - we're explaining how the cards=
 =

work. Some people will find the interpretations counter-intuitive and some =

will agree with our official interpretations of the card wordings (and it =

usually depends on whether or not you just lost against an opponent using =

Gee, you're the second person that's gone off on the WRONG tangent.  I don't
care whether the ruling on JOA/MFS is changed anymore.  WHAT I DO CARE ABOUT
IS A RULING ON WHAT TRASHING REALLY MEANS, AND A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION
OF PREVENTION.  Get that through your thick skulls, people.

You know what pisses me off?  You both took small aspects of my message, and
put them in such a context that it looked like I was unfairly criticizing
the rules team.  Honestly, if they can't take the time to provide a better
explanation of trashing and prevention for the rules v2.0, then they deserve
criticism.

So in conclusion, "... and the horse you rode in on."

I don't remember asking for your opinion on the subject.  My only demand is
that they explain exactly what "trashing" is, and explain prevention in

  You can get at least 1 bit 50% of the time from this card if you always
take 1 bit from each die.  So on a 1 take 1 bit, on a 2 take 1 bit and 1
roll, and on a 3 take 1 bit and 2 rolls.  The most my computer got at 1
time was 37 bits ( this was on a trial run of 10,000 ).

  If anyone wants the Qbasic code, drop me a line.

I would like to back up Len here, because having seen what it gives
on Magic: The Other Game, i don't want THAT to happen to netrunner.
It seems pure logic to me that only one wording for a given card
applies, whatever the version of the card. Please, make it so the
latest wording/errata issued is the only one in use, for the fun of
the game and the rest of the traders. I don't like the idea of a
MFS v1.0 having a demesurate value, while v2.0 will be snorted at.

In advance, thanks to the rules team for taking this into consideration.

Back door to Hilliard!!!!!

That is my link.  Here's why:

1) It's cheap.  I'm cheap
2) I run a whole bunch during the game just to keep the corp poor.
3) They tend to run out of bits, so I can walk any trace routines for
free.
4) Any 'Insta-Trace' card requires the corp to spend a minimum of 2 bits
extra just to find me.
5) I can't be chance observed/U renewal on the second turn (hasn't
happened yet) when I play this card first.

6*) Great flavor text.  Just imagine a bloodthirsty slobbering cerebus
trying to gain access to a College 'Virtual Classroom' and being stopped
by the pedantic school administration.  Totally cool.

That's pretty good.  Of course, I was in a grocery store with my friend Joan
the other day, and I tried to trash a ten-dollar bill to buy 3 bags of
Doritos.  She prevented me from doing so, and you should have seen the stink

I think you *were* unfairly criticizing the rules team.  You are also
doing so now.  Trashing and prevention are explained quite clearly in
the rule book, and it just may be the case that WotC employees have
better things to do than to explain basic rules of the game to people
who don't get it yet.

*Bzzzt* Wrong! Sorry, but this combo won't work
(although it was a good idea). Microtech says: "Whenever

You don't need a ruling, you need a clue.  Sparky has explained what
trashing means several times.  I've even explained it a couple of
times myself.  Why do you continue to ignore our explanations?

You *were* criticizing the rules team.  Sparky and I are both on
the team, and I at least was offended by your post.  Perhaps you
didn't *intend* to criticize the team, but the end result was that
you did.

I'm terribly sorry if something as simple as trashing is beyond
your ability to comprehend.  No one else seems to have a problem
*understanding* the explanations we have provided.  Accepting,
yes, but everyone else seems to understand them.

You know what pisses me off?  People who refuse to accept a given
explanation and continue to waste our time asking us to explain the
same thing over and over and over and over trying to get us to give
them the answer they want.

  Ok, ok.. I sat down last night, and went through all the ambush nodes, and

this was true. So it makes Speed Trap a useful card, just not useful against
the

My best guess at the templating for a card with that effect would be:
"...it does 2 Net damage per advancement counter on it, or 1 Net damage
if it has no counters or if it is not installed or rezzed."

(I didn't understand your other one - sorry!)

Sorry Z the other poster mentioned it has his rationale so I just

I think Z's point was a Pile Driver can Waltz through a Wall of Ice
for the exact same cost it would take to waltz past a tiny Data Wall.

So, his implied question is, "Since many folks use Pile Driver, why
should I spend 13 bits (if I recall correctly) for a Wall of Ice when
I can spend 1 bit on a Data Wall that will have the same effect?"

There are lots of lurkers, both on mailing lists, and newsgroups. Maybe
it's not as rampant in netrunner as it is in magic, but I'm guessing it's
the same for all CCG's, from experience & talking to people. As large
tournaments become widespread, more of it will happen.

Maybe it's a depressing way to look at human nature, but it's the only
thing that really explains why in magic (IMHO), tournaments are dominated by
clones of decks that have proven to win tournaments.

sure, but there is a difference between discussion and outright plagarism
discussion is what happened when you asked about CNC. Plagarism is when
You post a deck, and I take it to tournaments, and play it as if it were
my own. Discussion is good. Plagarism is what really makes CCG's look bad
and uncreative.

I'm not saying that anyone in particular is guilty of anything. I don't
have any way of knowing who made the first 23 imp deck... I don't care,
but when I see posts complaining about the lack of creativity, in
netrunner, and CCG's in general, I start to wonder, do our discussion
groups do more harm than good...

Other stuff:

Nanosurgeons...

I first thought that this was a cool card, esp. to use with Quest for
Cattekin. (my two runner rares from my first starter)

Then I read nanosurgeons carefully, and it's only if you got damaged in
your last 3 actions. So, if the corp zaps you on it's turn... or youu
take cattekin damage before your first action, you can't use the
nanosurgeons. I thought that was a bit uncool.

I think you're confusing Mike & Zonker. Zonker was the hippy tanner, but
Mike became the guilty yuppie. Zonker inheirited some money, purchased an
English lordship in time for Chuck & Di's wedding, ended up broke again,
and works for Mike as a nanny... As well as making a few bucks on the

My suggestion for better turn sequencing... All runners go simultaneously.
When all runners are finished, all corps go simultaneously. Speeds the game
up, avoids some complications, and generally works *very* well with 4 or
6-player team games. Should work here as well.

12 to 20 bits by turn 2 hmm lets see turn one actions 4
install 4 imps
turn 2 actions four
install JOA  draw  card play MFS pay one bit to return MFS net gain 14
bits zero cards in hand no runs done and no agendas scored.

Ok meanwhile on a similar note
Turn one 4 actions
SCORE SCORE SCORE SCORE
net gain 16 bits for four cards one card left in hand turn two available
for running

Ok sounds good to me I think I will just run out and buy me some more
JOA and MFS... NOT!

Dont you guys understand the JOA/MFS combo SUCKS if you happen to draw a
MFS on turn 12 or so after you already have your well built deck going
and are just looking for some extra bits or so for that one last run or
if you happen to have a JOA out then you can probably score some major
bits in the late game, But by then a good deck doesn't really need alot
of bits. By turn 12 my clown deck is running bitless for at least 3 runs
a turn using a good deck and a couple of stealth cards installed in
Affreets 3 clowns in another and a suite of breakers around (don't have
a bartmoss yet)
By turn 12 my other deck is running also pretty much bitless due to
keeping the CORP so poor very little ICE has been rezzed to cause me to
have to pay bits.
IN the early game there are better cards to score money that don't
require you to draw a combo of five cards. Get real just because someone
once posted that he scored big with JOA/MFS (and don't doubt you can
because it truly can be awesome in late game but once again who cares
except for psychological advantage) doesnt mean it is a KILLER COMBO
what it is, is a moderately good idea that has as much degenerative
ability as trojan horse/Urban Renewal and I dont see anyone clamoring to
ban this combo.

Most??? Two, I think. Setup works if not installed, but if installed, it
must be rezzed. I'm pretty sure Vacant Soulkiller only works when rezzed,
and I'm not sure about Trap!... Corprunner's Shattered Remains and
Experimental AI need to be rezzed...

Hey Zonker take a toke ok :) <----that is to take the sting of what I
said. You should be happy havent you read the ruling errata today you
have won. While I personally have always thought JOA/MFS was perfectly
fine, I really think the new wording is HIGHLY ACCEPTABLE and does a
great job of removing any ambiguity so what that the decision on how the
cards worked was reversed I never found the combo that usefull anyway.
And Hey I am happy too my SUL is now doing what I always said it would.

Subject:      Running Flow Chart

This is the running flow chart I developed with the help of Netrunner
R&D.  I think (well, I *hope*) it'll help you all with questions about
running.  There seem to be a lot of questions like, "Can I choose to
break subroutines in any order?"  I think this chart should help clear
things up.  Give it a try and see if it helps.  I'll gladly accept
constructive feedback and suggestions, too.

--

1)  Runner: Declare your run
    Is there any ice?
         Yes: Go to step 2
         No:  Go to step 13

2)  Runner: Approaches outermost unpassed piece of ice.  Special card
    effects can be used.

3)  Corp: Special card effects can be used, including rezzing nodes,
    upgrades, and the piece of ice being approached.
    Is the piece of ice being approached already rezzed?
         Yes: Go to step 6
         No:  Go to step 4

4)  Corp: Decide whether or not to rez ice
    Do you want to rez the ice?
         Yes: Go to step 5
         No:  Go to step 12

5)  Corp: Turns ice face-up (if it has not already revealed) and pays
    the rez cost in bits.  Ice is now rezzed.

6)  Runner: Encounter ice

7)  Runner: Break subroutines
    Can you break any subroutines?
         Yes: Do you want to break subroutines?
              Yes: Go to step 8
              No:  Go to step 11
         No:  Go to step 11

8)  Runner: Choose an unbroken subroutine to break (even one you've
    already failed to break in the same encounter)

9)  Runner: Pay to increase strength of appropriate icebreaker if
    needed. Since an icebreaker keeps normal strength increases until
    the end of the encounter with the ice, you should only have to do
    this once per piece of ice regardless of the number of subroutines
    it has.

10) Runner: Pay to break subroutine
    Did you break the subroutine?
         Yes: Are there any other subroutines you want to attempt to
         break?
              Yes: Go to 7
              No:  Go to 11
         No:  Go to 7

11) Corp: Unbroken subroutines take effect in the order they are listed
    on the piece of ice.  If any subroutine ends the run, the run is
    ended before later subroutines take effect.  If ending the run is
    part of a subroutine, that whole subroutine will affect the Runner
    before it ends the run.
    Did a subroutine end the run?
         Yes: Go to step 20
         No:  Go to step 12

12) Runner: Pass the ice

13) Runner: Special card effects can be used.  Also, choose to end or
    continue run
    Do you want to jack out?
         Yes: End the run
         No:  Go to step 14

14) Is there any more unpassed ice remaining on the data fort?
         Yes: Go to step 2
         No:  Go to step 15

15) Corp: Special card effects can be used, including rezzing nodes and
    upgrades.

16) Runner: Choose the order in which you want to access the cards
    there, including face-down cards.

17) Corp: Cards affect Runner in the order he or she chose.  Any
    face-down cards are revealed.

18) Runner: Score any agenda and pay the trash cost of any nodes or
    upgrades you want to trash.  They are trashed simultaneously, but go
    to the face-up archives in the order you choose.
     Did you score your 7th agenda point?
         Yes: Stop right there - you win!
         No:  Go to step 19

19) Corp: Deal with any consequences of having helpful nodes or
    upgrades trashed.

20) Both: Run ends. Deal with any 'end of run' effects.

Umm.. well, this is really a moot point now that the new ruling is out
(yea!) but I feel the need to defend my initial point.

If you have a deck that can consistantly (ie. over 90%) get 4 scores
out in the first 2 turns and still be a well constructed deck, I want
to see it.  The thing about the (now defunct) JOA/MFS deck that I was
playing is that you can get that out every single game.  Every game
you can depend on getting 12+ bits the second turn, or failing that,
15+ bits the 3rd round.  AND, you are installing useful things all
the while.

BTW, it's nothing as inefficient as you describe.  By turn 3, I've
also gone through about half of the deck and played everything it
needs to play which is another virtue over score x4; at the moment by
turn 7 the (now defunct) deck has everything it needs to start running
and is accessing about 10 cards per turn by turn 10 (well, that assumes
it doesn't encounter any agenda -- I figure you're smart enough to
know what that means).  With a little tuning, I think that the deck
could have reduced turn 7 to turn 5 and turn 10 to turn 7.

And yes, it did have tag protection (quite a bit as a matter of fact).

Blah.  Maybe I just haven't seen it, but I've haven't seen an trojan
horse deck.  Between 2 fall guys, a wilson, a junkyard, a ESC, and
some ability to gain bits, you'd have to be a very wily corp to be able
to bag the runner.

My friend plays instead with 2 full body conversions and an armored
fridge as well as other tag protection.  That works pretty well as well.

Which brings us back to *why* I tell runners to make reckless runs early in
the game: The corp doesn't want us to! The corp wants to be left alone, to
make preparations in peace and quiet. What the corps wants is certainly a

Think so?  OK.  Turn 1 you play Diplomatic Immunity.  Action 4 you
run my HQ and see a piece of ICE.  Corp's turn:

Action 1: Accounts Receiveable = tagged!
Action 2: Trash a resource; hmmmm, how about Diplomatic Immunity!?

Resources are the worst way to stop Tag'n'Bag because the Corp
can remove them so easily.  You need to avoid the tag in the
first place, with a combination of a good link (see the opinions
floating around out there right now) and a Nasuko Cycle, just
in case the Corp whips out a Trojan Horse.

Until a card is made that "locks" a resource into play, D.I.
is just a false sense of security.  Too bad, really.

Hardware is a much safer way to protect your hide (not including
the Emergency Self-Construct program).  Armored Fridge, Full Body
Conversion, Dermatech Body Plating, and Nasuko Cycle are all good
pieces of hardware that the Corp will have a hard time removing
and which make flatlining the Runner a chore.

Don't forget the Chrome, baby!  This is the world of Cyberpunk!
Metal and flesh made one, man and machine.  Gotta love it.

Hey guys.

We do not play it that way here.  If I run a subsidiary fort and
the Corp rezzes a BES, (assuming there is an agenda in the fort)
then I end the run without scoring the Agenda.  I (for whatever
reason) choose not to trash BES during the first run.

The card says "This does not affect any further runs."  If I run
again immediately, BES does not affect me.  We take it to mean
that BES does not affect any further runs against the SAME agenda,
whether BES was trashed or not.  The BES does not stipulate that
the card does not affect further runs IF trashed.

If this is correct (Sparky?), then I would like to suggest that
v2.0 clarify the wording in the last phrase to something like this:

"This does not affect any further attempts to score that agenda this
turn."

Anyone else?

Only Viral test site can be used when installed but not rezzed.
Trap and Setup can be used when not installed but is installed
must be rezzed (so are vulnerable to speed trap).

I guess it does make some logical sense, if the viruses you just
run into have to be rezzed, then they are really trojan horses :)

Subject:      Social Engineering

Hey folks.

Here's something for everybody.  When you play Social Engineering,
what do you do with the bits you don't put into your hand?

Do you leave them on the table?  Pick them up with your other hand?

What I'm getting at is, is it OK for the Corp player to count the
bits you did not pick up?  In casual play I guess this doesn't
happen much, but I'm concerned with tournament etiquette in this
case.

I think that the Runner should pick up all bits, take the amount
they want into one hand while keeping the others in a closed fist
above the table.  They extend the hand with the selected bits
while the Corp player guesses. Then the Runner opens their hand
to reveal the outcome.  I'm just thinking that its too easy to
keep tabs on the Runner's bit pool, and thus to nullify the card.

Anyone?  Everyone?

-----------------

On a related note, if the Runner chooses an unrezzed piece of
ICE to pass after successfully using Social Engineering, can the
Corp still rez the ICE as the Runner passes?  I think so, 'cause
the Runner still approaches the ICE before passing it, and that is
when we rez the ICE.

You know what? There's nothing like bribery to convince me.

CNC is cumulative!
I've seen the truth.

Ok. Now another question:

Where is it written in the rulebook that the corp mandatory draw
comes before "start of turn" effects.
It is written that this draw "start your turn", but is it a start of
turn event, that is must the corp draw before using the effects or
can it choose to use some effects and then draw?

I think it's the later, but it's late and I'm tired.
I just taught NR to two friends of mine and we had a blast with
untuned starters. Damn, this game is good.
(Sorry Moah, it was totally unexpected)

The only tournament I went to was a WotC event.
In one room, (most of the) NR players were having fun.
In the other room M:tog players were cutting each other's throats (granted,
in was the French championship finals).

A bit confusing. It could be:

12) Runner: Pass the ice. Runner & Corp: Special card effects can be used.
[some effects must be used while the runner passes the ice.]

13) Runner:  Choose to end or continue run

(other Corp special effects are accounted for in 2)

Are these really two different steps or can the runner choose the next
card after having dealt with the previous' effects?
I thought it was the later.

Altogether, a neat flow chart (but bear in mind that I love these things ;)

You know, this could be a great idea for new cards
(WotC employees, stop reading now)

Agendas that cost a little bit more than usual, but produce an effect
when stolen (give a tag, trash thinks, mess with the runner's health
or life).
This could be a good reason not to score an accessed agenda.

And if the advancement counter could be used to produce an effect...
(say, 1 tag per couple of advancement counters)
But then you'd need this sabotage prep that I talked about a few weeks
ago, the one that would allow you to remove advancement counters
from a card.

That would be the smart way to do it... The sneaky way to do it would be to
let the corp count the number of bits you have, and how many you leave on
the table, and use a little slight of hand to move one or two bits to your
other hand, ensuring the Corp will guess wrong if they've been paying attention.

I've recently reached the conclusion that no matter which way you lean on
JOA/MFS, it really doesn't unbalance the game. *But*

I suffered through a couple years of bizarre rulings on the *other* WotC game,
and I have to tell you, the main reason I switched to Netrunner was its
beautiful, balanced design and its (initially) lack of a need for "rulings" of
any type.

So along comes a two-card combo that can generate a ton of bits, even though it
defies the first-glance, common sense interpretation of how cards in this game
work. People on both sides of the argument write eloquent defenses of their
positions. Some write ugly ones :) Suddenly, some of the fun of *no longer
playing Magic* has been leached by this ruling. Do I still play Netrunner and
love it? Of course I do. But for all of us who arrived at this game from Magic,
this apparent move onto the slippery slope that ends with huge "timing
flowcharts" and scads of rulings for particular cards is really hard to take.

I disagreee with Stephane. I think this list *must* be a place where people
question the consistency and validity of rulings. Where else could this happen?
Isn't that one of the great things about being American?

I don't think this list is a good place to meet "weird people".

 L> Btw, why would you want to antagonize Sparky? He's a Netrep so,
 L> except on some occasions when he's ill or very tired ;) , he's right.

Being in charge of something *doesn't mean you're "always right"*! I doubt
Sparky would make that claim. Part of being a good leader or arbitrator is
being able to admit and correct earlier mistakes. They've certainly reversed
many rulings (some more than once) in *the other game*.

-Byron

I could agree with Stephane if I wanted to.

Well, maybe it _does_ matter what game you play. It's very rare that
anybody is ever accused of cheating in tournament Scrabble. I'd guess
it's even rarer for somebody to cheat in tournament Chess.


Obj NR:
I finally made a successful run with Social Engineering. The first
_three_ times I tried to use that card, the Corp guessed the number
of bits I was hiding. I'd take the dumb card out of my deck, but I need

        Uh huh.  The key behind JOA/MFS was never actually JOA/MFS, but
rather JOA/BMI/NGF.  The Misc.For-Sale was just nifty in that, if drawn,
it could provide a big surge of bits.

        In any case, I recently had a request for various styles of
decks I had observed in Netrunner, and while I more or less promptly
emailed back with a brief survey of decks I've encountered, I was
wondering, is there anyone out there who is playing a solid deck that
ISN'T primarily a JOA/BMI blitz deck?  I know from personal experience
that this style of deck is far from the only successful deck (and,
indeed, horribly ineffective against certain Corp decks), but it
seems that most people are pretty focused on this style.

I'm very good at guessing bits with SE.
I trained myself by playing Douglas Hofstadter's mind games (published
in Mathemagical Themas). In one of those, you can undermine the
other players bet by betting just below his bet but, otherwise, it's
the player with the highest bet who wins.
It does wonders for your synaps.

And after that, you'll feel curiouser and curiouser when playing SE ;)

I don't. My favourite runner deck is a sabotage/"rape R&D" one.
I've got quite good at using Cascade now ;)
I'm sure that I'll like the "bad reputation" cards from Proteus.

   Around here, we use dice (d10's are the greatest invention since the

(or Traces, for that matter). We simply use a separate hidden die to
indicate the runner's chosen value...

   This, and other reasons, is why, when I'm making a decision like this,
I simply determine the number of bits I "set aside" randomly. Corp
players soon learn to stop trying to psych out a die roll.
   I also use dice to determine what cards I'll pull from the Corp's hand
during a successful run on HQ (assuming I don't have *very good* reason
to do otherwise).

As you probably know, I hated misc.Joan and never use the combo.  I
have never had a hard time building deadly Runner decks.  Not all of
them work of course, but the ones I talk about are the winners.
The "Mechanical Man" deck that I posted a while back is very
effective and uses Blink-Force Shield as its primary engine.

Another favorite of mine is the R&D attack deck with ICE avoidance/
destruction cards and Restrictive Net Zoning to prevent the Corp from
protecting its vulnerable cards.  Microtech AI Interface and R&D
Protocol Files help make this puppy nasty.

Then there's my tourny deck which more or less uses a... wait a
minute.  Better hold off for a while.  My tourny deck is still being
fine tuned, but even so it has not lost yet.  I have not played a
true speed Corp deck yet, which is the real benchmark test, so once
I do I'll know if I have a winner or just a contender.  :)

I will post this deck on September 3rd for the group to chew on.

In friendly games, you're right that this is no problem.
However, in tournament, I have a large problem with anyone
putting their hands underneath the table for any reason
whatsoever.  (too easy to do sleight of hand).  I suggest (and
usually insist when I don't know my opponent in tournament)
that rather than holding the number of bits, that the person
write down on paper what the number is.  It seems the only
safe way to do this.  This goes as well for link/trace attempts.

I believe you're correct.  Looking at Inside Job, if the corp
couldn't rez anything before the runner "automatically passes"
a piece of ice, the runner would be able to breeze by a whole
fort of unrezzed ice.

"At the end of the turn, take the program into your hand."

Unline Magic, there's no 'phase' in which you check hand size.  As
far as I know, you just cannot end your turn with more cards than
allowed by your maximum hand size.  Discarding isn't an 'end of turn
effect' so it doesn't fit into timing.  It's just the last thing you
do during your turn.  Check for a discard after all those 'end of
turn' effects.

Actually, I wish Magic worked like that.... :^)

I've got an ice destruction deck that is vicious and usually only
loses to someone playing heavy tag and bag.  I can usually see
it coming and prepare for it, but sometimes they get me before
I can save my butt.

It eats speed processing corp decks alive.

I agree that the BMI/JOA/NGF is really common and boring.  My
corp deck usually makes people pay a lot for running with this
one.  Against speed weenie ice, sure it's fine, but when you're
running up against Haunting Inq, Cindy, Lich, Shotgun Wire,
etc, it gets expensive fast.

My friend has a Shell Traders deck that gets ridiculous(ly) fast.

Another deck I had that worked about half the time was my
Quest for Catekin deck.  When I got the fifth action within the
first few turns, then the deck started to hum.  By the time I
was at 7 actions, I pretty much had it wrapped up.  The main
trouble with it was when I couldn't roll a six to save my life
(literally).  Most actions I had a turn was around 12-15, I forget.

My advice to people who want to build solid decks without
BMI/JOA/NGF:  degeneracy.  Don't limit yourself to 4 cards of
a single type.  Go wild.  It really helps.  I'm not talking about
20 Scores in a deck.  20 Inside Jobs is another matter....  A
friend of mine is working on a deck with more than 5 Code
Viral Cache.  (ewww.....)  You'd be surprised what it's like
to always have what your deck needs in your hand.

Oh, and always have a fair chunk of meat damage prevention/
tag avoidance.  It's a dangerous Net out there....

I know of a cheating attempt in Chess. The guy asked to go to the toilets
and went to a stand where magazine were sold (Chess mags, of course) and
started reading magazines about the situation on the board he was playing
(Am i clear ? I don't feel so). But the other player had gone for a walk
too, and saw him. So he grasped the guy, with the mag open, and brought
him to the referees, the book still open at the good page.

There is also often some 'arrangements' around there, like admitting
null game when it doesn't hurt either player and such...

I heard that some french champion in Magic tried to corrupt his
opponent, by proposing some cool cards against the game he was
losing, that his opponent declined, called the referee who allowed
the champion to forfeit the tournament (i love this expression).
The rumor says that our champ got so pissed off that he punch the
ref.  He also didn't keep his promise to stop playing if he wasn't
qualifyed for World championship this year...

Well, rambling completely off topic, that's my mark.

Well, my highly uneffective deck does not have either a BMI or a JOA.
(Of course, i don't own either) It's a blink deck that has the very
weird particularity to always shoot 3 on the last piece of ice on the
fort which contains the agenda that will make the corp win if they
score it. So far, this haven't been proved wrong. (Now that i think of
it, it has proved wrong once. But my opponent was playing Rio de Janeiro
city grid, and for the first time in his life, he rolled a one.)

I love my deck.

Actually, if I were the Corp and I knew that you were rolling a die to
determine how many bits to set aside, I'd simply choose the highest number
you could roll.  Your strategy would indeed reduce the chance that I could
outthink you, but when I was right, I'd always hit you for the maximum
bits.

Then, of course, you'd have to think about changing your mind whenever
you rolled a high number.  And, once you start thinking about your move,
I could start to outthink you again.

There's a lot of information you can learn from picking a specific card.
For example, when I earn the right to draw a card, I quickly reach out
and put my fingers near a card and then pause.  Often, if I am at an
Agenda card, the opponent will flinch and say, "Hold it, let me mix them."
That tells me that there is at least one "good" card in his hand.  If
he doesn't flinch, I know I'm at a non-trashable card and select a different
one.

If I were the referee, I wouldn't consider that cheating.  That's simply
doing some research.  Likewise, I wouldn't call it cheating if he brought
some index cards that had different suggestions as to what to do in
difficult situations.  Of course, I suppose the Chess tournament has
rules against this kind of thing, so technically it is against the rules,
but I wouldn't personally consider it cheating.  Moving the pieces when you
shouldn't or playing Metalica on your boombox while your opponent is thinking
are what I consider cheating.

Likewise, if someone came to an MtG or NetRunner tournament with a crib
sheet that explained what to do with certain cards and in certain situations,
I would not consider it cheating.  I would actually consider it a smart move.

Subject:      Randomly choosing for Social Engineering...

        Is not a good idea. If I suspect that the runner is choosing randomly,
I simply state the number of bits he has as my (corp) guess. Why? Because
it is the most damaging. It's true I'll only guess right 1/n-2 of the time,
but I always get maximum advantage when I do guess right.
        If we play a psych game (with equal skill) I'll guess right 1/n-2
of the time with an expectation of getting rid of half of your bits. I've
effectively doubled the expectancy when I win.
        Of course, if you re-roll (or whatever) whenever you roll the maximum
number, then you aren't playing a pure random strategy....and we are back
to a psych game.

        For a game that that a lot of people claim has a random strategy,
but allows clever players to take advantage of random strategies, I suggest
6 nimmt! (Which was published in English as 6 Takes! I think. The cow card
game).

If you've read Hofstadter, he wrote that this was the optimal strategy
for his game.
It's not the funniest, though.

I'll use walls, you have to keep the runner honest.  I won't use anything
that costs more than 8 to rez, though.  13 is far too much.

I guess :)

I share your feeling about seeing this game generate rulings that defy common
sense. I don't/wouldn't like it either.

I *am* a great supporter of advocacy of one's opinion.
The operative word in my message was "pressure".
I think it's possible to expose one's problem without resorting to verbal
violence, something that has unfortunately already happened on this
still short-lived list.

And I'm sorry that you're not looking forward to meeting weird people

I have read the sci-fi issue, and almost all the others (I love Inquest's

Thank you WotC for your ruling,
continually striving to make netrunner much better than m:tog (practice
makes perfect).
I'd like if people might start posting more combo/deck idea articles to the
newsgroup, I like reading about these.
Also true stories, and slow up with the hypothetical situations that might
possibly bend the rules if a seven card combo is pulled off.
I'm trying to throw as much into this letter as I can, so I get everything
out of my head before I leave for camp.

Done.

15 cards, divided as close to 7/8 as the machines can.  No guarantees,
but that's how it's planned.

Out of curiousity, how were v1.0's boosters?  I know I saw a couple of
6/9 packs, but I didn't see *any* packs that ran 5/10 or worse.  Anyone
even see one of these?

As for the second question, I don't think I'm supposed to talk about
rarity and distribution yet, so I'll keep it under my hat until the set
(or a checklist) is released.

I don't recall WotC ever giving such information in advance.
I don't think there'll be any any vital cards, though.

I've just realized how few uncommons and how many
commons I had.

I always shuffle the cards in my hand and  present them face down to

I have seen very short games, where the Corp ran out of cards.  The corp
didn't protect R+D very well for a few turns cause they used planning
consultants and they had no agenda in atleast 5 turns.  Runner played a Skivviss
and made a few runs.  Corp was happy cause it filled up his hand, while
not paying attention to the size of his r+d.  he worked up to about 7
counters before he realized that it was killing him.  he had about 10
cards left in library when he (past tense of forgo, forgoed, forgot?)
his next three actions.  Runner gave him another 3 counters (help from
Weefie) and the corp new he would have to forgo more actions, but if he
did, he would take more counters, so he conceded (a turn or so before
he would have lost).  Closest I've ever seen.  It was about 8-10 turns
long.

Question for all you out there: How are you gonna play Misc.-Joan until
v 2.0 comes out?  I will probably show my friends the post, and most will
agree it is a good idea to play like that now, but if one person doesn't
agree we will have some rough seas ahead of us.

Oh well, glad they did this anyway (i don't care about the other two rulings

The way my friends and I play it is we let the corp count our bits.
Then we take all the bits in our hands, but our hands behind our
back seperate them into both hands, then put both hands foward,
and tell the corp which holds our bits, he guesses, we reveal.  We
then count bits to make sure no one cheated (or more likely dropped
a bit or two behind them).

Subject:      Virus Test Site Update

Regardless of what I might have said in the past, the rest of R&D
has supported my last interpretation of the Virus Test Site wording.
If I said otherwise in the past, I have to apologize.  I'm human, too.

As a group, we don't like the fact that it operates differently than
the other Ambush cards.  Wednesday, we'll discuss what we want to do
about that for v2.0, if anything.

Again, I'm sorry if I've given contradictory rulings, especially if I
gave them to you through Wendy.  I usually give Wendy the hard rules
info even when I'm away, so it's all my fault, not hers.

Anyway, the more I work with Bob and the others, the more I understand
the way they write the cards.  That's probably the root of the switch.

For those of you who missed it, this is the Rules Team's interpretation
of the card "Virus Test Site":

--

"You may advance Virus Test Site before and after you rez it. When
Runner accesses Test Site, it does 2 Net damage per advancement
counter on it, or 1 Net damage if it has no counters, even if it
is not installed or rezzed. Ignore this effect if Runner accesses
it from the Archives. If Test Site is accessed from R&D, Runner
must show it to you."

Read it this way:
"...it does 2 Net damage per advancement counter on it (or 1 Net damage
if it has no counters) even if it is not installed or rezzed."

It does 2 Net damage per advancement counter on it even if it is not
rezzed.

Since you can do this, it's usually polite to simply show your opponent
the card you take when you go through your trash or archives.  At least
in friendly games....

Right.  Ending the run and jacking out are not the same, so your run can be
ended even if a card prevents you from jacking out.

To the best of my knowledge, you're right.

Unlike the discard, the draw *is* a start of turn event.  As the Corp,
you can choose to mix it in with whatever other start-of-turn effects
however you choose.

Subject:      Dirty rotten cheating dogs

Someone said: "I'd guess it's even rarer for somebody to cheat in
tournament chess."

Cheating at chess gets worse all the time. The reigning world champion was
caught on video taking a move back a few years ago. Some people will hold
their clock buttons down for the duration of a time scramble. Some throw
their pieces on intersections during blitz games and force their opponents
to adjust them, or even worse, pretend the piece was on either of the two
possible squares, depending on the course of events. There are innumerable
instances of games being fixed after accounting for the prize-winning
expectancies of the parties involved.

Cheating at NetRunner is a newer beast, of course, since chess as we know
it is 500 years old, and NetRunner is, um, not quite that.

Along with the already-mentioned "draw a Setup! from HQ and ignore it, or
from RD and Microtech AI Interface it away," one also has to be wary of one
who brings two Crash Everett cards too close to hand, keeping both, then
trashing something useless. And I'd be *really* leery of someone who played
with Bartmoss, Playful AI, and Vacuum Link and rolled a whole lot of twos,
but who winced at the suggestion of playing with Blink or Quest for
Cattekin. ;)

Force Shield reads:
"Prevents up to 2 Net and/or brain damage total each turn."

This means that you can choose to have it prevent 0 damage when you are
damaged by an effect.  Now if the card had read, "Prevents 2 Net and/or
brain damage total each turn" you would automatically have the first two
points of damage you receive preevented, no choice.  The 'up to' gives
you the choice.

Dermatech Bodyplating, Green Knight Surge Buffers, Raven Microcyb Eagle, and
Techtronica Utility Suit should all say "up to 1" as well.  This change will
be made in v2.0, and you can treat it as errata now.  You'll still be playing
it the way everyone does intuitively :^)

There's no 'cumulative' here.  Process each Corporate Negotiating Center
individually as a beginning of turn effect.  They'll both work just fine
independent of one another, but you don't *have* to show the Runner the
same agendas with each showing :^)

Well, since no criticism was really intended, I guess I have to apologize to
Sparky! and the rest of the team.  Sorry, guys.  As far as your criticism of
myself, where have you been for the last two months?  I hate to give myself

I've stripped the others because they take research.  This one I can answer, though!

These are separate steps.  Since finding out what face-down cards *are* can affect
the decision, we have all cards chosen, then revealed/accessed.

Right.  If you re-access BES on a second run, the whole card text takes
effect and you can't score the agenda.  If you trashed BES on the first run,
it won't affect further runs.

Hiya,

I'm Tod Fox... I've been playing NetRunner for a while now, I think its a
kickass game, and I've been doing my damndest to recruit everyone I can.
I live in the Monodnock region of southern New Hampshire, so I'd be happy
to get together with any players in that area or in the Brattleboro, VT area.

Here's a tactic that the people I play with have started using:

hide your bits.  A starter deck box works good for this, just put your
bit counters behind it.  The opponent quickly loses track of how many
bits you have, and then won't be able to know ahead of time if you can
rez that Mastiff/afford that run.

That's because there's nothing controversial about the wording and/or timing
of it.  I agree it's powerful, but certainly not overly powerful.  A single
Diplomatic Immunity or Full Body Conversion can ruin your entire day.  I
always carry both in my competitive runner deck.

The Corp has the right to count your bits before you start the effect, but
once you've started the guessing game he's out of luck.  You can do exactly
what is mentioned above.

The pertinent part of the card reads:
"Then make a run on that fort, during which you automatically pass
that piece of ice."

Remember my little flow chart from yesterday?  My interpretation is that
this card forces the Runner to go straight from #1 to #12 for the first piece of
ice without passing the stuff in the middle  The stuff in the middle (step #3,
actually) is where you get to rez ice.

1)  Runner: Declare your run
[...]
12) Runner: Pass the ice

Thrill me with your acumen, Clarice.

1. The amount you post has very little to do with your ability to play
Netrunner.

2. The amount that you do post has very little to do with your ability
to play Netunner.

For all you know I could be some guy who knows nothing about Netrunner
but is spouting off things he heard from his friends.  On the other
hand, I could be Richard Garfield using an alias and choosing not
to add anything because I don't feel like it.

Now, if you go out spouting off something someone thinks is stupid,
that person has a right to flame you, regardless of how much they know
about the game, as long as they back up why what you said was stupid.

And I don't care if you're Einstein (or really Berkeley (sp?), if you
do psychology/philosophy) .  If you tell me that I'm just a figment
of your imagination, I'm still going to call you stupid, despite the
fact that I know just about nothing about philosophy.

I'm pleased with the errata, but I do not take the position that I won.
This was a war, and nobody wins in war.  If you want an analogy, I feel like
a survivor who is relieved that the fighting and destruction are over.

I can't rub it in, mainly because there were two airtight explanations, one
for each side.

And for all of you rules teamers out there, the fact that there were two
completely feasible explanations for the same problem meant that errata of
some kind in the rules (or the cards) actually WAS necessary.  The JOA/MFS
combo could not be officially resolved any other way.

Take, for example, the card Preying Mantis.  Without the words "this damage
cannot be prevented", it would generate a similar effect.  Such wordings
seem to suggest that Richard Garfield may not have intended the prevention
of a cost to still generate the desired effect, and that MFS may have been
an aberration.

AND LASTLY (I only capitalize to draw attention to this particular
paragraph), Dave Orr just now helped me to understand what the real problem
is.  My intention was NOT to demand that the rules team change rules, I
merely demanded <g> that they DISCUSS the rules.  At least that's what I
MEANT to say.  Now I'm REALLY embarrassed. :)

I know.  The current way that I play situations like that is to have the
bits that one or both wish to spend written on a piece of paper.  It's too
easy to cheat the other way.  Too Many Doors is the same way.

Sparky, correct me if i'm wrong,but in the case in which the ice
you chose is not the first one (Inside job is there for that...)
you have to normally deal with each piece of ice before the chosen
one, right ? Or do you just skip all ices before the one you've
chosen and automatically appear behind the chosen one ?

I ask this, because what you've just said implied the second
possibility, whereas the card seemed to imply the first.

I thought the runner had to bring the Aganda home before he/she could

I don't think that vitals are supposed to be less powerful than
rares or uncommons.
And that's one of the things I like about this game.

I know, AI Boon is the best sentry-breaker out there, if you have
the bits to pay for it, but rare cards are just more specialized
cards, not more powerful ones.

Did you have this question in mind when you made the flow chart? I
doubt it. An other sign of this being a hasty decision is that going
from #1 to #12 is not what you by any means do. The runner may f.ex.
choose to automaticly pass ice no. 4 at the datafort. He then first
encounters ice 1,2 and 3 (if they are rezzed or the corp chooses to
rez them) and then "automaticly pass" ice no. 4.

It is clear from your flow chart that you have passed the ice in #12
but where are you considered to start passing it?
Both #5 and #2 seem to be logical.
Sparky seems to choose #2.
Why not choose #5?

Well, I guess I got to leave this to R&D.

ObHumility: I've just re-read Richard Garfield's piece in the last Duelist

I know I should be more tolerant toward people who don't really care
about winning or losing a game, but NR is so involving (to me) that
I find that part of the fun comes from exploiting your opponent's mistakes.
Hopefully, I'll work on it.
If Richard would just stop designing such good games, it would help me

The number of bits in your bit pool, the number of cards you
have in your hand and the contents of Trash and Archives is
not hidden knowledge. Both players may ask for that
information at any time.

I wonder, though, if you must tell the following to your opponent:

- The number of cards (left) in your deck;
- The number of cards you cut with AI Interface.

It could be important if the corp has a good memory and I just want
to cut a random number of cards after he's used Planning Consultants.

I know that in friendly play, you should give this information, but
what about competition?

It's dealt with in the part where the cards in the fort take effect.
It got me too at first reading.
That's why you can win by playing Lucidrine with no cards in hand.

  I am sorry. I didn't realize that whatever a game maker decides to put
in its Official Dictionary was LAW.  Just because it is in the book
doesn't make it legit.  Try using that in your next English paper.  It
may be ok, but I would think that the proper usage is 'more stupid'.  I
could be wrong or I could be too old.  When I was in school stupider

        I'm sure Sparky is pointing out some point of truly obscure

Anyone else?

I would say no. Note the first line:

"Runner does not score any agenda (or agendas) on a run during
which Bizarre Encryption Scheme is ACCESSED"

If you don't trash BES, you can't score the agenda until you crack
the codes at the start of your next turn (this would reperesent
running into a fort, encounterinmg a BES, taking a copy of the
agenda home, and  working on it there.). However, if you DO trash
BES, then you're not accessing it on subsequent runs that turn; you
can score the agenda normally (you run into the fort, encounter the
BES, pay the trash cost to install a decoder in the data fort, then run
later to pick up the decoded information).

Just my 3 bits,

Hi all, two questions.

The first is probably an in-house type of answer. If a runner runs on HQ =
and accesses a card. Puts it back because he cant trash/score it. Can =
the Corp now shuffle his HQ ?
The reason i ask is that i am fed up making 2+ runs on teh HQ and =
drawing the same card. How do you guys handle this ???

Second, Proteus. I have been thinking about the bad publicity rule, is =
this going to make agenda's harder to score. ie. i have two bad =
publicicty counter, my agenda's will cost two extra points to score.
Will teh corp get bad publicity counters for playing evil agenda's like =
corpwar and political overthrow or will they be given by runners? If the =
runner runs a fort and steals a "bad" agenda shows it to WNS who =
publically shame the corp.
(unless the corp is WNS who keeps it quite, tags the runner and urban =
renewals him :*) )

Just some thoughts
Rob.

        HQ is supposed to be hidden- there is no rule requiring the Corp
to keep the cards in HQ in any particular order.  Yes, it's frustrating
to keep on running HQ and get the same card over and over again, but
that's life.  If you want to get around this problem, you can play with
cards such as Executive Wiretaps (increase chance of accessing that
Agenda), Gremlins, and Romp through HQ.
        In my mind, the main reason to access HQ anyway is to play
sabotages, so I rarely worry about this...

        Hmmm... this brings up a good point.  Supposedly Proteus is going
to hit the streets on September 3rd.  Is this the most unadvertised
expansion set of all time or what?  I haven't seen ANY mention of Proteus
except from Sparky & co- no full page ads (like when Netrunner came out),
no "oh, boy Proteus is coming" mentions in various magazines, whatever.
Is this some fantasy that Sparky dreamed up, or did they just forget to
tell the WotC Marketing department about this?

Hi,
someone posted (Foolkiller?) that he had a runner deck that hasn't lost
yet. I'm never going to play in any US tourneys anyway, so if you would
like to try vs my corp in irc (without R&D files-unplayable), you're
welcome to. Currently unbeaten by non JOA/MFS. Lost narrowly twice to
JOA/MFS (one of them was to my deck) - both of us had scored 2 agenda
each, and it was pure luck of the draw who scored the next. Its quite
often 10-0.

I beat a "cycle through the scores!" [I've no idea how many he had] deck
today only 10-2 because I made a stoopid mistake.. he played social
engineering and had 10 bits left, he needed 8 bits to break the other ice
on the fort. I just had to guess "2" in order to prevent the run. Instead
I guessed "3" and he only had 2 in his hand (all the ice was unrezzed and
concealed), so he got thru' aargh!

Stephane: (yeah, he's famous enough to merit personal attention)
I'm using cascade in my runner deck too, almost 90% of the time corp
declares he's forgoing 3 action once there're 2 counters - almost a
timewalk :)

NR boosters dropped to about us$2.10 today (IA & 4th ed was already $1.95)
that should attract an even larger pool of NR players and enhance card
availability.. yahoo :)

Ach, it may be about hacking but it's not very cyberpunk, is it..

Since anything that's an hour plus long and gets a cinnema release
counts as a 'film' in my book I'm going to nominate a couple of
cartoons..

Ghost in the Shell -
           japanese manga thing. Has the full whack really -
cybernetic enhancement, cyberspace, AI's, solos etc etc etc..

Heavy Metal  -
           OK, so hardly anyone's seen it, but the bits I have seen
look very cyberpunky too..

   Reactions can be deceiving, but if it works for you, go for it... :)
   I see all kinds of psych games, some more devious than others. This is
a standard: when a path to HQ opens up, the Corp holds his hand out and
lets you pick after your first run. Whatever you pick, the Corp doesn't
shuffle and just keeps the hand held out, inviting you to run again and
knowing full well that you know where the card you just picked is. The
implication is obvious: "Feel free to waste your actions, there's nothing
here. Go on. Pick 'em all. In order."
   I've seen Corps do this with three cards, two of which were agenda.

   For my own part, I find Urban Renewals and Trojan Horses very
slippery... :)

   Fair enough. You go your way; I'll go mine and I'll get inside the

   Spending bits is a fact of life for the runner.
   I think I will make it a policy to roll a die (or dice) with higher
values than the number of bits in my pool, though, just to accomadate you.

   I've read some Hofstadter, but that wasn't what I focused on at the
time (I had other things on my mind when doing so).
   It's kinda funny when the Corp decides you're fudging the die roll.

Speaking of AI Interface. Lets say you are running with AI Interface and R&D
Files.  You use R&D Files and find 2 agendas clumped together. You only have one
run left this turn. If you cut down to the first agenda and score it, your
opponent draws the second one into his heavily protected HQ. Instead, you can
cut down to the second agenda and score it. Then as your first action next turn
you cut corp's entire deck except for the last card (which is the first agenda
that you viewed with R&D Files) and score that one as well.

Subject:      2 questions

Ok, I have two questions, pardon me for sounding newbieish :)

1) This has to do with the corp archives...  can a corp look through its
own face down pile any time it wants too, or only on a card that lets it
access its archives(offsite backups)?  The reason I wonder, is that if a
runner accessing the Archives trashes a node or upgrade, does the corp
get to find out what was trashed?

2) A more netrunner-l specific question: I'm curious about these irc
games, can someone give me a good node for getting at efnet so I can
watch/play.

I will happily accept the answers to both these qs in private email so as
not to spam the list.

Looks great except for one thing...

Under 15, I believe that the corp should determine the order in which
upgrades are accessed.  Many upgrades are ambush upgrades, and the corp
can assume to be setting up a trap for the runner when they place these
upgrades.

I would also be quite happy if the corp was allowed to choose only the
order of ambush upgrades.

Seems fair, no?

Strange Days was kind of Netrunnerish, especially if you want to consider

   This is a matter for debate, but may I suggest that we all might be
better served to learn the difference between a critique and a flame. One
is constructive and non-hostile. The other is ranting. Others are more
likely to consider the former than they are the latter. Insults are not
arguments...

   What say we don't dismiss, off the cuff, whole realms of study just
because they sometimes put forward controversial (sometimes untenable)
ideas, even if that were the subject matter of this list.

Subject:      Hello all

Hello all. Just started reading the list and decided to end being a
lurker/leech.

I wanted to start it off by thanking WotC for a nice card game. I finally
found a card game that follows its rarity rating. Unlike other card games
which I play, I didn't get alot of rares when I bought a box of boosters, 1
starter, and a handful of boosters. At first I thought I was cheated, but
soon came to my senses that this was fair.

Also, I find the different view points to be helpful, but I am thankful to
live in an area where people take the spirit of the meaning of the cards
rather than the literal english of the card. This does not mean that the
people who literally take the meaning of the card are bad, so there is no
need to discuss that.

Hopefully, my subsequent posts will have more value. Thanks for the list!

Has anyone mentioned RoboCop yet?  A lot of the plot of that movie
is pretty similar to the NR cards that cover the "real world."  Full Body

Subject:      Remote Facility

I've talked to R&D, and they've given me their unwritten rule for
this situation.

When a card states that you will get an extra action per turn, you
must declare when you use it.  If something trashes a Remote Facility
during the Corp's turn and the Corp has not declared that it had used
the Remote Facility's extra action, they lose it.  A smart Corporation
will probably declare each turn that the first action they take is
their bonus action.  In 'formal' play, it's not assumed.

Hope that clears things up.

For this sort of thing (usually this is what we do for traces), we have
some dice handy.  Rather than using bits, we hide the dice behind our
cards and pick our amounts.  With a d6, the six is usually used to
represent zero bits.  Multiple dice will allow you to choose six or
more bits.

That way it doesn't matter what bits are in sight.  It's my
understanding that players have the right to know how many bits are
in their opponent's bit pool.

Wouldn't work for me.  Generally playing the Corp, when it's Runner's
turn, I keep my hand squared up and in the fort.  When the Runner
successfully makes a run on HQ, I pick them up flat, then shuffle them
a few times over and under, and then hold them out flat to the Runner to
pick.  I know what's in the hand of course, but don't kow the precise
card the Runner will pick.

The other thing I prefer to do is have the Runner point to a card and
have me pull it out myself and hand it to him.  I've had times when the
Runner pulled the card out of my hand and 2 or 3 other cards also fall
out due to friction and sometimes fall right side up.

Sorry about any confusion - I have a real answer now.

You must encounter a piece of ice before you pass it.  This means
that the Corporation has a chance to rez the ice before it is passed.
On the flow chart, it looks like this:

1)  Runner: Declare your run
    Is there any ice?
         Yes: Go to step 2
         No:  Go to step 13

2)  Runner: Approaches outermost unpassed piece of ice.  Special card
    effects can be used.

3)  Corp: Special card effects can be used, including rezzing nodes,
    upgrades, and the piece of ice being approached.
    Is the piece of ice being approached already rezzed?
         Yes: Go to step 6
         No:  Go to step 4

4)  Corp: Decide whether or not to rez ice
    Do you want to rez the ice?
         Yes: Go to step 5
         No:  Go to step 12

5)  Corp: Turns ice face-up (if it has not already revealed) and pays
    the rez cost in bits.  Ice is now rezzed.

6)  Runner: Encounter ice

At this point, if a special card tells you to automatically pass a piece
of ice, you skip straight to:

12) Runner: Pass the ice

If you think that this is a common-enough occurance, I can plug an
option into #6, which would read:
   "Does an effect cause the Runner automatically pass this ice?
         Yes: Go to 12
         No:  Go to 7"

I liked you idea, I really liked another list member's idea (sorry I forgot
your name) of writing down the number.  How about using a different counter?
or maybe using counters from the bank. That would still have no affect when
the Corp (runner) keeps track of counters. I don't know how people would
feel in tournaments about this.. but IF the people play fair and deduct the
correct number of bits from ther pool (if needed) then this is a good
solution.

I bet we're all hoping for a link card somewhere between Access through

Isn't this illegal.  If I'm in the middle of a game and someone won't show
me how many bits they have, I'll kindly explain that if they don't show me

This brings up an interesting question. This has infact happend to me before.
Lets say the corp has a VTS (or Vacant Soulkiller) and an agenda on
a namatoki plaza.  The VTS has flatline the runner, and agenda to let him win.
He runs in and access the two cards.  Does he:
a) lose the game to VTS
b) win via agenda
c) end in a draw
d) throw the universe out of whack (I've done this a few times in M:TOG)

   Yes; archived (discarded) agenda are fair game.
   Corps *score* agenda. Runners *liberate* agenda.

   Scored or liberated agenda are set aside and counted toward the seven
point victory condition. Any special abilities of *scored* agenda can be
used by the Corp provided the conditions for doing so exist and the Corp
can meet the costs of using them.

   Yes. It takes one action and one bit to put one advancement counter on
any advanceable card, including agenda.

I guess I missed the final say on how Speed Trap can be used when running a

Could somebody please clarify how this card works with these three cards.
The confusion lies in the fact that Speed Trap can only be used after a
corporation rezzes a node or upgrade. Since these cards are not usually
rezzed by the corporation, Speed Trap would pretty much be useless against
them.

   Yesterday, when playing Corp against a player using The Shell Traders, I
had the luxury of trashing The Shell Traders. The player had a card
with shell counters on it at the time, but had sufficient bits to pay to
remove the remaining shell counters. He, "in response," paid to remove
the remaining shell counters and installed the card. I have doubts about
the legality of this.

   Can he do this? If not, why?

When your mail gets sent to you it goes through at least 2 different
computer systems. The one the sender calls Host and the one you call
Host. In between it can go through any number of other systems this
routing sometimes is very confusing (try sending a message to
billgates@microsoft.col (misspelling is intentional) the message will
not get through but you will recieve a message telling you all the
places it tried to go.) Anyway sometimes this routing will cause two
messages sent from the same host to the same person to be delivered in
much different speeds this is caused by the traffic pattern at that
time. (basically some of your mail is caught in a submarine uplink)
relax be patient eventually it will all come.

Hello,

Hey FoolKiller I hope you don't mind but I used your name for a name for one
of my Cyberpunk GM PC's.

On a nettruner note two cards I got a rock and Trap! one word Ouch!

Here's a card idea:

ESA Mass Driver Acess

Operation Black Ops

If runner has 4 or more tags do 6000 meat damage.

Spoiler: So what city did you say that Runner was in?
But...but won't that take out the city?
Sure, but if he is a block or so away from his house it won't matter.

If i remember well, both cards say "up to 2 ... damages", meaning that
you choose how much, including 0 if you want.
Can they prevent negative damages ? (the stupidest question ever, i

Subject:      Crash Everett...

My favorite "useful-card-to-play-with-Crash-Everett" is Junkyard BBS.

I rarely play without both of these cards, so it's not like I built my deck
around this combo, but it IS rather nice to know that the card that I decide
to Trash with Crash Everett can be picked up right away with Junkyard BBS.
  In fact, I always Trash the second card that I pick with Crash Everett.
That way, I keep cycling through my deck. The only time I ever DON'T Trash
the card is if I need more cards in my hand, and I'm drawing twice in a row.
Then, I can be assured of getting the best 2-out-of-3 cards in my hand, with
the 3rd sitting on the top of my Trash if I want it.

Anyway, I know that it's not the most efficient, or coolest combo, but I've
gotten quite used to the "luxury" it provides. <G>

I don't know about anybody else, but after about the third time I use Mantis
to get a card from the deck [and Junkyard BBS to recycle Mantis], I start
feeling guilty...<G> I might as well play with my Stack face-up, and play
with only two actions per turn...picking whatever card I want instead of
using Mantis/JYBBS. I start feeling guilty because my deck isn't random
anymore. Sure, I have to spend 4 bits & 2 actions to get a card, but there's
no more suspense. I no longer have to worry about getting the right card.
  In fact, I almost took Mantis out of my deck, but without it, I am usually
at a horrible disadvantage until I get the right cards out. (i.e. JYBBS,
icebreakers, etc.)

I believe the Runner wins the game s/he has scored (accesing the cards
in the order he/she decides) the agenda and gets the 7th point game ends
here. Take these quotes from the rules book.

"Immediately" means before any other action is taken in the game.

If multiple events take place at the same time, the player whose turn it
is
chooses the order of those events.

Yeah, I do it the same way.  You can't read my face if I don't know which

Fellow Netrunners:

I have a FileMaker 3.0 Database that contains all relevant information
about each card (name, type, corp/runner, cost, strength, etc.) INCLUDING
paraphrased text and ALL current rulings, errata, and interpretations
from Sparky and this list. There's even a space for your own notes about
the card; and, as a special bonus, I've added a page that visually shows
the flow of Sparky's run chart (at least my visual interpretation of it).
The database is about 300K, but I need a place to post it. If you've got
an FTP site I can use, let me know and I'll email you a copy and let the
list members know where you can pick it up. You'll need FileMaker Pro 3.0
for Windows or Mac to use the database. If there's enough interest, I'll
make a standalone version.

It's cheating.  The player obviously did not have enough experience,
knowledge of the game, and/or skill to win.  The research should have been
done beforehand.  I ask you this: You're taking a final exam. You don't know
the answer. You decide to sneak out to look up the answer in your textbook.
Are you cheating?

Same goes for CCG's. If you take advantage of the ability of Microtech AI
Interface, it's cheating. There must be some method of making sure that
Trap!, Setup!, and Virus Test Site are actually acknowledged by the runner,
without resorting to turning cards 90 or 180 degrees, and without needing 1
referee for every 2 players in every tournament, which would be an ungodly
expense.

I don't want to fan flames over any issue any longer, but typically official
errata is enacted a little faster than immediately.  If you are playing a
fun game with a group of friends who all agree it can be used, that's fine.
However, you couldn't play it in a tournament, and if you are playing a fun
game with someone who doesn't like it, you should defer.

Actually, Whirling Catapults can make a wonderful gruel if you season them
properly.

I agree, though.  Spending hard-earned cash to get a fourth uncommon and no
rare can be infuriating.  I heard they did it to balance out the number of
rares per 15 cards, but I'd rather they didn't do that.  With 8/7 on the
sheets as Sparky mentioned, it sounds like R6's are back yet again.  Yech.

Hmm.  The only problem with that is that it's too easy to cheat.  I'm not
saying that you would, of course, but there are sleight-of-hand artists out
there who wouldn't mind slipping a couple extra bits in. Or, even worse, a
player, trying to count your bits in his head, may count wrong, accuse you
of cheating, and pretty much start a big mess.

Restrictive Net Zoning doesn't really hurt you, it just slows you down.

For it to work the runner has to focus on one data fort.  This ussual
means he is using other cards that focus on one data fort(in your
case Cascade) Take advantage of this.  You can place agendas in forts with
a lot less protection than you would normally feel comfortable knowing that
all things being equal the runner will opt to run R&D.

Restrictive Net zoning is purely a bit penalty.  Good bit gainers can help
you overcome it, and a runner to focused on putting cascade counters
on you will be less likely to go after your bit gainers (and if they do
you have achieved your objective any way).

Don't waste actions trashing Cascade counters when you only have a few and
almost never trash them if there is a resnoable chance the runner can run
you again the next round.  It would take a huge amount of cascade counters to actual make you lose the game.  The most important thing is to either score enough
agendas to win or keep the runner out of R&D.

If the runner throws two(or even one) restrictive net zoning on you early
in the game don't assume it is a luck draw.  Place as much ice as you can
afford on the restricted zone.  Odds are if he drew two of anything on the
first round he has much more than two in his deck.

Of course this advice is rather general, I would need more information
on exactly what your oppponents deck is doing to give you the best way to
beat it.  What is he using for ice breakers?  bit earners?  link?

Gee, I guess I DID ask for the flaming to continue. :)

Anyway, I prefer to actually believe that the participants on this list will
be honest about whether an idea they present was their own, or merely
plagiarized. I've seen enough posts by Stephane, Len, Foolkiller, BitByte,
and others to know that they all know what the hell they're talking about.

If I take credit for any ideas, they would be 1) The use of Financial
Transactions Expert with ambush nodes, and 2) proving that phase 1 of the
game doesn't necessarily exist.  Oh, and of course, bringing up the issue
about cheating with trap nodes/Microtech AI Interface, which could have
dizzying ramifications if a feasible solution cannot be reached.

Honestly, I really only know 3 other people in my area who play, and none of
them have more than 20 rares.  Their decks are so generic it's painful.

I think that Sparky was speaking about Corp/Runner cards distribution and
not about rarities.

I believe your options would be:

1)Roll for Quest, then sell it, but only if you didn't roll a 6, in which
case   you can't.
2)Sell it and don't roll
3)Roll for Quest, and sell something else
4)Roll for Quest and sell nothing
5)Sell something else and roll for Quest

Yes, though of course Pile Driver is also very specialized.  It KILLS walls

Well, Momma always said, "Stupider is as stupider says".

To put it another way, he who says "stupider" probably is. :)

It's just for style points.  Well, you could also conceivably do it for 2
other reasons:

1) You want your opponent to think you're a dangerously insane psychopath
who    will kill them if they don't let you win.
2) You want to convey a sense of supreme confidence, and hopefully psych
them    out.  More likely, though, they'll still just think you're crazy. :)

Nope.  This is what makes Microtech AI Interface essential to any good
runner deck.  Another option is to use that card that allows you to look at
the top 5 cards of R&D rather than accessing them.  The name escapes me, but
it isn't rare.  If you have a good memory, you can choose to run when you
know an agenda is on top.  If you have a REALLY good memory, you can use it
to replace SeeYa, Ronin Around, or Mouse, since you'll know what's likely to
have been installed.

The final ruling for Virus Test Site says that this card must not be
rezzed to effect the runner ( card text:...even if not installed or
rezzed ). So if you access VTS in a SDF Speed Trap! is useless,because
there is no need for the Corp to rez the card.

On Setup! and Trap! you just find the phrase:...even if not
installed.Nothing about not rezzed.So these cards must be rezzed to
effect the runner,when he accesses them in a SDF.So you can use Speed
Trap for this two cards.

If you access VTS,Setup! or Trap! in R&D or HQ,Speed Trap is useless
too.

I know, that's why I hated to do it.  Now, any mistakes are magnified, and

On the bright side, I named quite a few others that I think are good

That can indeed be done, but it's so annoying that I don't participate.

There are generally three ways of doing it:

1) You just take your decks and play.  Cheating is VERY easy to do, and wins
can    be controversial.  You can essentially draw any card you need at any
time,    even if you don't own it.  Of course, this last part is a problem
no matter    which method you choose to play.

2) Two players both send the contents of their decks to each other, and
numbers    are assigned to each card.  Then, a "random" number is sent for
each card    drawn, each number corresponding to a certain card.  Again,
cheating can    easily happen, as you can choose your opponents' next card
if you want.

3) Have a third party that both players trust provide the random numbers.
This    is the best option, but you can still claim that you have 4 Roving
Subs in    your deck, even if you only own one starter deck worth of cards.

The worst part of it is the detail you must go into so that your opponent
knows exactly what your playing field looks like.  Sure, you can cut &
paste, but I still find it tedious.  Also, a single game can take weeks,
even months to play.

LOL.  Its amazing how this game starts to take over your mind.  I was
recently watching the Olympics with family, and a rather paranoid
computer security commercial came on.  Both myself and my mother(a recent
convert) starting shouting, "I'm gonna steal your agenda!"  Hmm...

My circle of NetRunner players are also working on ways to combine NR and
m:tg.... I tap one agenda point to put Giant Growth on my Mastiff.  Ouch.

There is a solution to this problem.
It may be as painful for people who play with card sleeves and tweezers, but
you could let the other players use the cards you don't put in your deck(s).
I do.
If you have enough cards, you may often be surprised by what your friends
come up with with the cards you didn't want to play with :)

I could write a sentence with more withs if I wanted to.

Subject:      Short Fiction

The Militech corporate security center was quiet this evening.
A half-eaten pizza and a dozen empty soda cans lay strewn around
the circular table.  The circular room's walls were covered with
monitors, each reflecting various sites in and out of the Net.
The darkness was punctuated by the phophorus glow of the screens
and the digital readouts from the massive array of hardware.

Dieter's seat was empty at the moment, and his monitor belied
the truth about security perimeter seven.  The Mastiff software
set up to ward off intruders appeared to be running fine, but
appearances can be deceiving...

"Dreff, hand me that back-up disk the southern office flew in
today.  And get your goddamn soda off my magazine."

"Screw you Jenny.  Here's your stupid disk."

"Where the hell did Dieter go?  Didn't he say he was just going
out for a smoke.  Chester's out sick, and Esslin is a screw up.
How did I get hooked up with you wanna-be's?"

--------
The chill night air penetrated Dieter's thin coat.  He took
another drag from his cigarete, blowing the smoke from his
nostrils.  He watched the guards patroling the gate one hundred
meters away, illuminated by huge sweeping lights.

He finished his smoke and flicked away the butt.  The silent
bullet slammed through his skull as the cig hit the ground.
Steam rushed up from the tiny hole.

Two silent figures slipped away toward the system relay station.

--------
"Oh shit!"  Jenny started up and quickly dashed to Dieter's seat.
An alarm began sounding and a red lamp switched on inside the tiny
room."

"Someone just entered the third ICE in sector seven.  That's R&D!"

"Christ, Dreff, if anyone gets in there it'll be our ass!"

A panicked look washed over Dreff's face as he scrambled for the
hardcopy of the Mastiff program.  Jenny struggled to get the
crashed data wall in the second line of defences back in operation
but an Immolator routine had already destroyed most of the code.

Dreff slid the CD into the loading station.  He slipped a jack into
his temple and his eyes glazed over as he became reconstructed in
Net-space.

--------
As the crystalline form of the intruding Runner leaped and ran
across the virtual minefield the third ICE formation began
to rez.  The slight graphic interference diturbed the sharp
images as the new program integrated itself into the virtual
world of the Net.  The ground erupted as several lethal Data
Darts shot into the air.  Their code quickly found the Runner's
signal and they began their attack run against him.  The first
Dart impacted the Runner and sent a lethal pulse of energy
towards his mind.  The deck's surge buffers absorbed the shock,
but they burned out in the process.  Two more Darts struck the
Runner's humanoid icon, blasting his cortex with sharp bursts
of directed energy.  Then the backlash hit him.  As he stumbled
into the data storage nodes of R&D a final surge of power cut
the Runner's access to his stored programs, preventing him from
breaking any further ICE.  No matter, he was almost there...

--------
"I see you, you little fuck.  You're in for a little surprise,
prescribed by your Doctor!"  Dreff hit the activation button
on his terminal, and the Mastiff program rezzed inside R&D...

--------
The Runner's icon quickly began scavenging through virtual file
folders, looking for the plans for the Corporate relocation.
His new "girlfriend" told him the files were here, and all he
had to do was find them.

The growl behind him had a tin sound, like a metal dog snarling
through a blown out speaker.  He turned ready to fight and saw the
massive black and blue neon hound, towering above his own icon.
The roof of the construct had derezzed to allow the program to fit
inside.  The spiked collar blazed electronically.  Then the pearl
white teeth began to gleam against the dark background.

The Mastiff snapped at the Runner's tiny icon.  He raised a hand to
enable his Krash program but it fizzled in a spurt of disassociated
electrons.  The jaws of the killer ICE locked into his signal and
sent the initial pulse of damage through the Net.  Then it fired
its most lethal electronic poison which coursed through fiber-optic
cables straight back into the shocked boy's head.

His body convulsed violently in his father's chair.  The jolt forced
his head backwards sharply, yanking the jack cables from his temple.
The life monitor light on the temple plug switched from green to red.
His brain sent a flatline signal to the monitor and it began to
emit its high pitched distress signal.

His mother cried out from downstairs...

---------
<The next day..>

"Find out who leaked the information.  I suspect that new temp
in R&D has something to do with it.  Find her and see if she knew
the boy."

The dark man in the pressed suit turned towards the bitter killer
sitting across his desk.  The solo wore a long army green trench
coat with 22 dog-tags hanging from the left shoulder.  Dirty clothes
and long dread-locked hair portrayed him as a street bum, but the
outfit allowed him to get into the street crowd.  His arsenal
of weapons bulged beneath the coat.  A scar ran the length of his
worn and rugged face, crossing the right eye, which now glowed with
a hideous red light.  Two days growth covered his jaw, which now
let a small smile break the hardened image.

"And if she did..."

"The usual.  I'll give you your standard fee even though she's not
a physical threat.  This intrusion has made me very angry."

Foolkiller stood up and turned.  He walked silently out of the
office, with a bounty on the head of a young girl working for
Edgerunner Temps...

THE END?


Hope you enjoyed!

um, lemee see,

Sneakers, although not really cyberpunk, or wholy dedicated to computers,
had some neat cracking stuff, and the idea of breaking into corporations,

Freejack (Mick Jagger of the stones, and someone else, Emilio Estevs
perhaps) in a very cyberpunk future


and some additional Netrunner trivia:

the name Wilson (weeflerunner apprentice) comes from the Gibson book,
Count Zero. The original Wilson (can't remember his last name) was
described as a total fuck-up. The main character refered to himself as a
wilson whenever he made a mistake. There are several good "runner"
stories in "burning Chrome", a compilation of Gibson's short stories. The
best (imho) is the title story, Burning Chrome.

Question: I have been trying to put a virus deck together, and have provisionaly
included "Code Virus Cache" (Resource, 1 to install) -
"Play only if you made a successful on HQ this turn. If the corp forgoes actions to
lose virus counters, two counters of your choice are not removed. The corp may trash
viral cache by taking an action to pay 5".
I assume this means that the corp can trash CVC anytime in their turn, and that CVC
can only be "played" by the runner when the corp forgoes actions in the runner's
turn, and only after the successful HQ run?

Deck idea: I taught a friend how to play Netrunner, and during his first game as corp,
he created multiple subsidary data forts, all lightly guarded. This was contrary to my
usual strategy, which is to create a few heavily guarded forts. The interesting thing
was that it created so many choices for me as the runner, and made "see ya" or "mouse"
harder to use just because of the actions wasted (although it made "I Spy" more
attractive). Based on that game, I have created a deck with lots of cards that can be
advanced. Here's a perfect game: draw lots of ice; guard R&D, and create multiple
subsidary forts; draw more cards; start installing "experimental AI", "Vacant
soulkiller", "corprunners shattered remains", "Information laundering", "Vapor ops"
and agendas ("project babylon" especially); advance nodes and agendas each turn. Faced
with so many choices, the runner is going to have to spend all actions running and
getting potentially wasted, or using mouse/see ya. As soon as the runner uses mouse, I
install a "namatoki plaza" on a fort with "vacant soulkiller" advanced, then install
an agenda their as well, and it's locked up tighter than a very tight thing. Ideas?
Thoughts?

Opinion: I think the runner is at a disadvantage for one reason - their decks are
slower. A runner has to cater for all corp desks (tag&bag, speed, etc) which means
some cards will be useless in their deck, while a corp can tailor their deck to have
100% useful cards for the chosen theme. Mantis, short circuit etc get around this to a
degree, but they also cost actions and bits, and you're slowed down again.

I quote the Sparky runner flowchart and the way the game is played around
here:

17) Corp: Cards affect the runner in the order he or she chose.
18) Runner: liberate any agenda and trash anything you can.

Since Virus Test Site and others are dealt with in 17, the runner would
flatline before reaching 18.

The exact same thing happened to me when I taught the game to one of my friends.
We played with starter decks, so I didn't have the bits to run as often as
I liked,
but a constructed deck would have it much easier.
He did manage to score a 7 counters Info Laundering and made my life hell.
This could be a good strategy for sealed deck events.

Bah! (What *is* BMI, anyway?) I have three runner decks. One is a weak clown
deck. One is a Rigged Investments/Floating Runner/Loan From Chiba money
deck, with a ton of R&D Interfaces. My favorite (and arguably the best) is
the breakerless deck, centered around Inside Job/Social Engineering/Security
Code WORM Chip/Core Command Jettison ICE. Other decks I've had were the
general-purpose deck (my C-64 deck) and the poor-man's runner deck (nearly
everything with an install cost of 0 or 1; no bit gainers except ESM,
Databroker, and Luciderne) which was actually quite a bit better than I
expected it to be...

That's the silliest thing I've ever heard! Do you *really* play against
people with such horrible poker faces? I only play against one guy who does
that, and he mixes it up sometimes so that he winces when I'm about to grap
a Trap! or Setup!. In short, I can't trust his facial expressions. And
nobody else shows any. Personally, I always look amused when the runner is
waving his fingers over my HQ...

Don't touch it!!! I think it's a Good Thing (tm). There *should* be at least
one ambush that Speed Trap is ineffective against. Otherwise, poison pill
decks would be almost totally wasted be anyone with a Speed Trap. No single
card should make the runner feel so invulnerable.

I couldn't find it anywhere in the rules, but I'm sure this is illegal.
Sparky? Care to make a ruling, or show us where the rule is?
The potential for cheating with a hidden bit pool is enormous, and it takes
quite a bit of the strategy out of the game.

You seem to be thinking of Inside Job... Social Engineering isn't

deck)

No, because calling it the Force Shield deck also gives the Corp the wrong

Well, it doesn't have much to do with Netrunner, but as a general cyberpunk
flick, I think Strange Days is one of the best!

And don't forget Johnny Mnemonic, with his MRAM, his bodyguard, his stealing
of agenda, and various other Netrunner bits and pieces (icluding, if memory
serves correctly, a code gate they had to break to access the agenda from
his brain? Or maybe that was more of a Bizare Encryption Scheme?)

Simple, really. Either install Microtech AI Interface, or just don't run a

Stupid me! I thought (for some reason) you were talking about R&D. Yes, the
corp can shuffle (that's the word that made me think it was R&D, and not the
cards in hand) his HQ anytime he wants to.

>>The reason i ask is that i am fed up making 2+ runs on teh HQ and drawing

Life's tough that way... As corp, I *love* to see the look on the runner's
face when this happens.

Sorry. Again, I was thinking R&D, not HQ.
To solve this problem against HQ, use HQ interfaces. Also, Coordinated
Strike on HQ (or whatever the name of the card really is) also will help.

Set them aside. They can no longer be run on by the runner, nor do they take

Nowhere. They stay right where they are.

Having lost my rules book I refer you to the online rules book.
at page http://www.wizards.com/Netrunner/NR_Layout_Corp.html wich shows
a picture of the corps layout it shows clearly the bitpool unhidden and
the message underneath says "HQ (our cards in our hand and our bit
pool)" I know this is about as Anal as the tap is 90 degrees fight we
had in M:TOG but the fact is that the bit pool is an area that is freely
inspectable by both sides at anytime the trash and archives(face up) are
also that way. the runners bit pool is also seen in
http://www.wizards.com/Netrunner/NR_Layout_Runner.html although no
mention is given that it is to be associated with anything.
I repeat it may seem Anal but the fact is it is neccesary to prevent
cheating.

I can vouch for the helpfulness of this route.  One of my friends owns
several thousand m:tg cards.  Not only does he trade and often loan, but
he also makes a practice of building decks for people and giving them to
them for free or cheaply.  Not only does it make him a bit of money, but
it also solves the problem of not having enough people to play with.

The TV series was based on the British film, which is quite differant in
some ways(the reporter who is the basis for Max Headroom dies, rather
than surviving).  Max Headroom was a great show, I remember it fondly.
Its major problem was that it was way ahead of its time.  Nowadays it
would do much better.

That's what the prep "Synchonised Attack (on R&D, here)" should be.
Maybe there'll be a prep that would allow the runner to "disable"

You have too much time on your hands, though, and an unhealthy

Two cards already do (something like) what you're looking for:

I have serious problems with Rigged Investments/Floating Runner.

Greetings folks. Just got on this list yesterday, and spotted this. Most
likely, I'm the mean opponent Frisco's referring too. :) I'm still
working on the deck, mainly cause I'm only now learning how to run, and
still don't have a really big clue. The main strategy of my deck is to
put about 4 cascade counters out, and generally make a nuisance of myself
until they trash an agenda. I've got 8 RNZ's in my deck, so I usually put
3-4 on R&D, and the rest on HQ or the Archives. A couple inside jobs,
Bartmoss with Patel's Virus, and I usually do pretty good. The deck is
pretty weak against tag and bag right now, but I haven't faced many of
those yet so I'm still clueless as to what to add/take out. Anyway,
here's the current version of the deck. If anybody has any tips, I'd
appreciate them. My big decisions right now are do I use Bartmoss, or go
with a cracker for each ice type. And, how to fit in more RNZs and Inside
Jobs. I won quite a few games putting 3 RNZs on R&D in the first turn,
then Inside Job/Junkyard BBS on through.

Here's the deck:

8 Restrictive Net Zonings (Trying to fit 2 or 3 more)
2 Zetatech Software Installers (I hate paying for Bartmoss if it goes away)
1 Force Shield (Might add 1, dunno yet)
1 Dropp (Keep the Corp poor earlygame, and see what it's got late game)
1 Joan of Arc (Keeps Bartmoss around)
1 Afreet (will morph into a Succubus when I get another)
2 Succubi
1 Newsgroup Filter (Bits 'n Bits 'n Bits)
1 Bartmoss
1 Mouse (Hmm, is that gonna hurt, or make me happy?)
1 Cascade (Nice and annoying, might go with Gremlins/Shredder instead)
1 Pattel's Virus (Goes good with Bartmoss. Heh, your ice is -8)
1 Forged Activation Orders (Use it or lose it you sellyourmotherformoney
                            Corp *^%%**&%$$)
1 Access to Arasaka (Link)
1 Access through Alpha (Big link)
1 Inside Job (How about a deck with 15 RNZs, and 15 Inside Jobs)
1 Nasuko Cycle
6 Livewire's Contact
1 Quest for Cattekin (OUCH!!! That's the 5th 1 in a row!)
1 Silicon Saloon Franchise (bit or a card, bit or a card, hey! I don't
                            have to worry now)
4 Jack 'n Joe (Now where's those RNZs---Might swap 1 for N.E.T.O)
3 Mantis
1 Militech MRAM Chip (ever have 3 of these out, and STILL have a handsize
                      of 2?)
3 MIT West Tiers (Might drop the Jack 'n Joes cause of these)
1 Junkyard BBS (Trash it, or Smash hit?)
1 Shell Traders (Leftover from when I had AI Boon in this thing)
1 Short Circuit
1 Arasaka Owns You (I Gotta Rock? I got something for you too pally!)
1 Total Genetic Retrofit (Is this thing really as cool as it looks?)
1 Tycho Mem Chip
Total = 51 cards

The runner isn't invulnerable with Speed Trap. It's a card whose sole
purpose is to prevent ambushes, as other cards prevent meat or
net damages.
I think that if Virus Test Site stays as it is, noone will ever play with
Vacant Soulkiller again... and that would be a shame :)

No, not Running Man ;)

There's an excellent French adaptation of Sheckley's The Prize of Peril
(Le Prix du Danger) which puts Running Man to shame. As if Arnie

Virus Test Site is immune to Speed Trap, but I'm not sure about Setup and
Trap, because neither contain the words "or rezzed."

Of course, it is my personal opinion that Trap and Setup cards are best used
to protect HQ and R&D.  Installing them in subsidiary forts is bad strategy.
Much better to use a Virus Test Site in this situation, even if Setup and
Trap were immune to Speed Trap.

Hell no he can't.  Netrunner has FIFO timing, which is to say, completely
the opposite of Magic.  Your friend has Magic-itis, and can't accept not
being able to respond with an interrupt.

Anyway, as soon as it's gone, it's gone.  For example, if you played
something that trashed a resource and gave a tag, and then you decided to
trash a Wilson, he couldn't respond by trashing the Wilson to avoid the tag.
He'd have to get another copy out before he could take the counters off.

Usually, I just use a toned-down deck with a few good cards in it.  Play,
though, does bring out things that you can't see by just looking at the
cards. At first, I didn't think a Broker was very good, but the first time I
played with one...

About the only thing i can think of that even barely fits to the theme of
Netrunner type movies, is probably J. Mnemonic ...
Others might include Max Headroom, but it's pretty old and IMHO doesn't
quite capture the futuristic feel of J.Mnemonic or Netrunner CCG.

Does anyone know about those plans on Blade runner II ?

Subject:      Tons of R&D Interfaces?

Well, I personally can't stand hardware. Especially when theres a better
software out there. R&D interface costs 4 to install vs. R&D protocol
files which cost 0 and takes up 1 MU. I can't seem to be able to bring
myself to pay 4 for a interface... it seems so... expensive. HQ interface
is probably a bit better cos' there's no good s/w available. Expert
Schedule Analyzer? Maybe.

Of course, my aversion to hardware may be due to the fact that I have
only 2 shell traders (lying around gathering dust next to my roving
submarines :)). Once I get 5, maybe I can build that kind of deck.

I don't know about the other runners, but I'm constantly short on bits
(even though my first priority is to install newsgroup filter). Maybe
its all those black ice so many people are playing with. I think only 2
players have anonymous tips which is the main reason. [oh yeah, my corp
deck doesn't take advantage of lack of anonymous tips amongst players -
its has 4 black ice out of 16/17 ice only]. Whereas I've encountered
players who play with multiple mastiffs & liches & other black ice...
Once I get my hands on an anonymous tip, they'll think again. Muahahaha.

I saw an advertisement for Proteus in a magazine, and I saw a card called
THE DECK.  It was a hardware of 11 to play.  It had the ability for
1: (or so, I'm not quite sure) to give a baselink of 5, and 1: to add
+1 to the link.

Pretty cool, but damn expensive.  Atleast it doesn't take up MU, can't
be tag-trashed, and can beat a Turbuea Delacroix for a reasonable amount.

Question: Why do you trash the card with Crash Everett, just so you can take it
back from your library, instead of putting it on top of your library and taking
and action (as opposed to an action an a bit) to do the same thing, with the added
benefit that you see the next card on top of your library, and can take or trash
that. <Phew> That was a long sentence.

This can be a fatal mistake.  Though it may take a while to "deck" the corp,
the cards that are dropped in archives could be agendas, and I NEVER like having
to protect archives.  Also, I saw a game the corp let Skivviss counters grow
to seven.  He was happy his hand was alwaysed replenished, but wasn't so happy
when there were 2 cards in his R+D

Subject:      I keep getting jacked out by DCI

  I have made several runs against a corp in the last 12 weeks and ended up
getting jacked out every time.  The corp is THE DUELIST CONVOCATION.  I
ordered my membership package via phone with my credit card (so I know it is
not a payment problem) and I have not gotten anything from them.  No
start-up package and no Duelist #11.  I have spent almost as much in phone
calls as I did for my membership.

  This corp (DCI) uses a lot of specialized ICE :

1. The dreaded VOICE MAIL. (Press 1 now....Please leave a message for us to
ignore.)

2. THE CHECKS IN THE MAIL. (Oh, that is going out today [week 11].  Let me
know if you don't get it by next week.)

3. The ever popular WE DON'T HANDLE THAT HERE. (Please call 555-YOUR-SCREWED
for that.)

  I am very tired of being jacked out (around) by THE DUELIST CONVOCATION.
This it to them --- YOU HAVE MY MONEY...I WANT MY STUFF.  JUST HOW MANY BAD
PUBLICITY COUNTERS DOES IT TAKE TO KILL A CORP !!!???.  TWELVE WEEKS (12) IS
TOO LONG.  YOUR UNCARING ATTITUDE IS OFFENSIVE.  AT WORST YOU HAVE STOLLEN
MY MONEY.  AT BEST YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE (for lack of a better word) SUCKS.

  To the rest of you I am sorry for the waste of your Netrunner space.  But
I would like to know it I am the only one getting screwed like this.

I have a couple more rule question.

1) Is restrictive net zoning cumulative?

2)This ones sort of complicated ,I'm opretty sure it
dosn't work but my friend is concvinced it does.My friend
was playing corp and I was using shredder uplink to run .
He had a Jenny Jett on HQ and said he could use her ability
to add a piece of ice to hq but make me have to go encounter it.
Shredder does say threat this as a run on hq and jenny says something
like is a run if successful on this fort add a piece of ice to the
end of and the runner must eoncounter it(I don't own the card so I
don't know the exact wording)

Also I was wondering if anyone had any intersting first turn
stories.One of my favorite things to do if place Dreff for my first
action than draw 2  bits.Then the runner ran there and I dropped
Liche.Now everytime I drop a card and draw bits my friend will
inside job or sneak preview for some sentry breaker.
