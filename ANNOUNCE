======================================================================

Up-to-date example configurations:
* examples/orodruin/
* examples/win32/
* examples/morannon/  (not that much up-to-date ;-)
* examples/point/     (new)
* examples/node/      (new and incomplete)

======================================================================

Changes in 4.3.5:

* ftntick: new -x --exec-script option to run e.g. announcement script.
  ftntickpost: skeleton for such a script.

* ftnpack, ftnfattach, bink_attach() in general: search FLO file for
  entry with file attachment, only attach if necessary. ftnpack now
  avoids adding to orphan arcmail packets not listed in any FLO file.

* sendmail configuration: no longer uses copy of m4 copy files, but
  symlinks to /usr/lib/sendmail-cf. New redhat6-orodruin.mc config
  file for RedHat 6.0 and sendmail 8.9.3.



Changes in 4.3.4:

* Removed out-dated examples.

* New module strtok_r.c, re-implementing old strtok(), xstrtok()
  functions. 

* New module rematch.c, regular expression handling for 1st line.

* rfc2ftn: new config option Regex1stLine, regular expressions for
  finding addresses in the first (and second) line of the message body
  for replies.

* Documentation doc/fidogate.* now completely up-to-date for this
  release. New examples for point configuration in examples/point/



Changes in 4.3.3:

* packet processing: yet another bugfix for Zone 0 packets.

* Win32: added missing config.make to examples/win32/

* rfc2ftn: major improvements to charset handling. Now parses MIME
  headers and correctly outputs ^ACHRS and ^ARFC-MIME-Header. Charset
  mapping Internet -> Fido is now implemented.

* ftn2rfc, rfc2ftn: AI_2 and AI_7 patches are now fully integrated,
  fixing some things along the way. New config option
  UseXHeaderForTearline enables using X-FTN-Tearline, X-Mailer,
  User-Agent, or X-Newsreader for the Fido --- tearline.

* Documentation: major update, chapters on config files and example
  configurations are now up-to-date for version 4.3.

* Solaris 2.x: proper definitions in config.h and src/include/declare.h.



Changes in 4.3.2:

* parsedate() and date() tested for Y2k compliance, everything is (and 
  was!) OK.

* Major code clean-up for node-as-ascii-string output functions, using 
  static buffers where possible and avoiding the usage of tmps
  strings.

* misc.c:run_system(): cmd[] buffer was too small, now BUFFERSIZE,
  in particular fixes ffxqt problems with long command lines.

* config files: inline comments are no longer supported, only lines
  starting with (some white space and) '#' are treated as comments!

* charsetc: some bug fixes.

* Win32 port: some bug fixes and work-arounds, compiles with Cygwin
  B20.1. New example config files in examples/win32/.

* Areafix: %unlinked lists only areas with access rights (level, key).

* Updated texinfo documentation: at least the sections on compilation
  and installation are now up-to-date for version 4.3.x.

* Packets with zone information (really *old* tosser programs) are
  processed with the default zone (from 1st aka).

* rfc2ftn: CheckAreasBBS should now work if gateway address and main
  address are identical.

* rfc2ftn: AI_9 patches obsoleted.

* rfc2ftn: preparation for charset mapping support (will be finalized
  in 4.3.3).



Changes in 4.3.1:

* logdaily: updated.

* logsendmail: major changes to analysis and output format.

* areasbbssync: -l creates diff listing for text output.

* runpoll-binkd: poll script using BinkD.

* out-rm*: updated.

* version.h code changed as follows:
    VERSION_MAJOR	major version number
    VERSION_MINOR	minor version number
    PATCHLEVEL		patchlevel
    STATE		development ./. stable
  Current version: 4.3.1 (development)

* Removed the last remaining ultra-ugly code from the original ifmail
  - shuffle.h and SHUFFLEBUFFERS! FIDOGATE now uses the new temporary
  string code in tmps.c with memory management throughout the various
  programs.
  This *may* result in some memory leaks in version 4.3.1, the new
  version is not yet thoroughly tested!

* An sprintf() replacement str_printf() is now used throughout the
  FIDOGATE code, avoiding potential buffer overflows. If your C
  library support snprinft() it will be used, otherwise FIDOGATE
  terminates with a fatal error if a buffer overflow occurs.

* Gateway programs: fixed some bugs with the new configuration file,
  GateAddr and the handling of the -a / -u command line options.

* All test cases have been updated to the new single configuration
  file fidogate.conf (that's internal for me, the test cases are not
  included in the source distribution).

* rfc2ftn: parsing of *.maus.de addresses removed, config options
  MausGate, MausDomain are now obsolete.

* ftn2rfc: bugfix memory allocation.



Changes in 4.3.0:

* New, and improved versions of the various runxxx scripts and the INN 
  interface scripts.

* General clean-up of scripts/ directory, obsolete ones removed.

* gate.cgi: new FIDOGATE status CGI script.

* Updated morannon example config files (NOT using the new single
  fidogate.conf, but the old 4.3a5 config files).

* runpoll: new generic version without the ffx programs (suitable for
  most FIDOGATE points).

* Allow configuration with only Address statements, Uplink or
  GateAddress is not necessary, if main and gateway address are the
  same. 

* Started to get rid of some of the ugly shuffle.h stuff.

* rfc2ftn: code to generate ^AORIGID removed (already disabled per
  default).

* config.make: NEW DEFAULT CONFIGURATION IS NOW A SINGLE CONFIG FILE
  /etc/fidogate/fidogate.conf FOR ALL PROGRAMS!!! (The different 4.3a5 
  config files can still be used by changing the corresponding
  definitions in config.make, line 91-98.

  Currently, there is only one example of the new single config file:
  examples/orodruin/fidogate.conf

* ftntoss: config option EchoMail4D renamed to TossEchoMail4D to avoid 
  conflicts with rfc2ftn configuration.


======================================================================

Needed:

* GNU CC or ANSI C compiler
* GNU make
* GNU flex/bison or lex/yacc
* Perl5
* GNU m4 for the sendmail m4 configuration
