Major changes in FIDOGATE 4.0:

* Areas in AREAS.BBS must now explicitly marked as passthru (dir entry
  must start with `#'), otherwise ftntoss will write packets for the
  own address as well.

* A lot of new config options (see examples/...).

* If the KillXXXX options are not specified, ftntoss will put bad
  messages into packets in SPOOLDIR/toss/bad.

* File attach processing: option -F must be used with ftnpack.

* Dupe check: ftntoss now uses a MSGID history database if enabled.
