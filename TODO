X = for next release

	* rfc2ftn: option to use node address, not gateway point
	  address for local users.

	* run*: Use ftnconfig.

	* config.c: implement cf_pinbound() returning value of
	  PInbound. Fallback to Inbound, if PInbound is not set.

	* config.common: implement PInbound, UUInbound

DONE.	* config.gate: NetMailOptions, same as options in AREAS file.

DONE.	* ftn2rfc: MIME header

	  MIME-Version: 1.0
	  Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
	  Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
	  
	  MIME-Version: 1.0
	  Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
	  Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
	  
	  MIME-Version: 1.0
	  Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=iso-8859-1
	  Content-Transfer-Encoding: QUOTED-PRINTABLE
	  
	* "BestMatchAKA" parameter for all programs. Similar to
	  setting AKA based on current zone, using the AKA with best
	  fits the sender/receiver. For multi-point operation.

	* config.c: make Origin/Organization normal cf_get_string()
	  parameters.

	* config.c: make cf_p_*() use char * instead of char [].

	* ftn2rfc: check ^AREPLYADDR for valid Internet address. At
	  least check for something like ^AREPLYADDR Thomas Hamm%500:531/0.

	* rfc2ftn: config parameter to disable/enable X-Flags
	  processing. Add config parameter for specifying addresses
	  allowed to use X-Flags. Automatically using X-Flags: MN for
	  local users sending mails to Fido.

	* ftn2rfc: rewrite, split huge unpack() function into parts
	  for processing netmail and echomail.

	* ftnroute: crashmails to points via boss node.

	* ftn2rfc: process ^ARFC headers. If RFC level 1, import
	  important headers such as Date, Message-ID. If RFC level 2,
	  import all headers present.

	* ftnflo: pipe to program processing the entries (e.g. send
 	  with FTP)

	* rfc2ftn: better parsing of first line, don't use RFCAddr
	  parser.

	* ftntick: remove FILES.BBS entry for old replaced file.

	* ftntick: if node is busy, put necessary data for
	  bink_attach() into separate file, don't wait, retry on the
	  next run.

	* ftnpack: remove 0-size arcmail from previous days.
	
	* ftnroute: new command "xroute" allowing routing based on
	  source *and* destination address.

	* ftnhatch: copy option: copy file to file area and put entry
	  into files.bbs (standard hatch behavior).

	* ftn2rfc: bounce messages should include the complete FTN
	  message with all kludges etc. to ease debugging.

	* kludge.c: handling traversing multiple kludges of the same
	  type.

	* ftnpack: runtime configuration of arcmail extension
	  usage. Use XX0-9 only, XX0-9 + XXA-F, wrap around to XX0 if
	  last one is too large, etc.
	  ArcMail extensions: mo[0-9], plus mo[a-f], maybe mo[a-z]?
	  runtime configuration of arcmail extensions usage.

	* areas: option -M MAXSIZE, limit maximum RFC message size to
	  MAXSIZE bytes, larger messages won't be gated.

	* ftn2rfc: restrict gateway to certain *Internet* addresses.

	* ftntick: announce new files via mail or news posting.

	* X-Gateway / ^AGATEWAY processing.

	* ftn2rfc: Newsgroups header?

MOSTLY	* ftnpack: better file attach processing, -F DIR option. Don't
DONE.	  copy netmail packets (do_noarc()), use rename(). If archiver
	  fails, move packets back to toss/out directory.

	* Check packet passwords of incoming packets.

DONE.	* MIME support for outgoing RFC messages, especially using the
	  ISO-8859-1 character set (8 bit and MIME quoted printable)
	  for news messages.

	* ftntoss: check # of ^AVia lines

	* ftntoss: kill old messages (older than 2 weeks?)

OS2	* MSDOS, OS/2 port: switch stdin to binary mode. Command line option?
DONE.	  Problems with news batches (GD030V)?

	* ftn2rfc, rfc2ftn: passthru operation for FTN messages, in
	  particular EchoMail control information.

	* ftntoss: strip ^APATH for ZoneGate

	* ftntoss: ZoneGateFrom as suggested by <slapic@fido.hu>:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
i receive mail from 1:270/101 as 1:270/104 (so i'm 1:270/104)
my normal address is 2:371/2000
i must forward/pack echomail as 2:371/2000
i should strip seen-by and path when forwarding mail from 1:270/101 
regardless whom i'm sending to.

at this moment i have two installed fidogate, one with aka 1:270/104, and 
one with aka 2:371/2000
my 1:270/104 system receives from 1:270/101, and packs for 2:371/2000
2:371/2000 receives from 1:270/104 and processes mail as normal.
and at the end, 2:371/2000 exports to 1:270/101...
it's not so nice... working, but not nice... i'd like to use one system 
on a phisical system.
so if i can do something like this:
ZoneGateFrom    1:270/101       270/101 104 371/2000
ZoneGate        1:270/101       270/101 371/2000
and as the zonegatefrom specifies, fidogate should strip seen-by and path 
every mail _from_ 1:270/101
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	  This requires setting the sender address for the particular
	  area. Something else?
