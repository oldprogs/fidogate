X = for next release

	* doc: add areas -L, LimitMsgSize, #define DO_HAVE_SYSEXITS_H

	* ftnpack: special option to process ffx control and data
	  files.

	* doc: add RFC header in Fido message body documentation
	  (From, To, Cc, ...)

	* doc: add X-Flags documentation.

	* ftn2rfc: improve processing of RFC address user%do.main and
	  user@do.main in FTN to field.

DONE.	* ftn2rfc: if 7bit text, do not use MIME quoted-printable.

DONE.	* ftn2rfc: process MIME Content-Transfer-Encoding header in
	  FTN message.

	* rfc2ftn: configuration option for mail RFC level *per*
	  *host*, e.g. option in HOSTS.

DONE.	* ftn2rfc: option to kill split messages (^ASPLIT).

	* rfcaddr.c: using quotes for "som(e)thing%special"@host
	  causes problems with news reading. Son-of-rfc1036 saiz that
	  quotes are not allowed in addresses.

STARTED.* DOS/OS2: use \ for path names when running commands via system()
(ftnin)

	* ftntick: call script for incoming TICs, passing file area,
	  name, ...

DONE.	* ftn2rfc:702: config option, instead of @FQDN, add @addr_to.addr
	  (domain part of recipient's FTN address).

DONE.	* rfc2ftn: limit max. message size

DONE.	* areas: option -M MAXSIZE, limit maximum RFC message size to
(-L)	  MAXSIZE bytes, larger messages won't be gated.

	* ftnaf: marker in areas.bbs to show if an area is subscribed
	  at the uplink (option or using directory), regularly check
	  if area is subscribed by any downlink and send add/del
	  request to uplink.

STARTED.* Replace calls to strncpy0/strncat0 with str_copy/str_append.

	* "include" for reading routing/packing config file.

	* Generic alias matching: name@Z:N/F.P <-> user@do.main (Name),

	* rfc2ftn: improve parser for 1st line. Use regexp library?

	* rfc2ftn: option to use node address, not gateway point
	  address for local users.

	* "BestMatchAKA" parameter for all programs. Similar to
	  setting AKA based on current zone, using the AKA with best
	  fits the sender/receiver. For multi-point operation.

	* rfc2ftn: config parameter to disable/enable X-Flags
	  processing. Add config parameter for specifying addresses
	  allowed to use X-Flags. Automatically using X-Flags: MN for
	  local users sending mails to Fido.

	* ftn2rfc: rewrite, split huge unpack() function into parts
	  for processing netmail and echomail.

	* ftnroute: crashmails to points via boss node.

 	  with FTP), new scripts senduu, senduumail.

	* ftntick: if node is busy, put necessary data for
	  bink_attach() into separate file, don't wait, retry on the
	  next run.

	* ftnroute: new command "xroute" allowing routing based on
	  source *and* destination address.

	* ftnhatch: copy option: copy file to file area and put entry
	  into files.bbs (standard hatch behavior).

	* ftn2rfc: bounce messages should include the complete FTN
	  message with all kludges etc. to ease debugging.

	* ftnpack: runtime configuration of arcmail extension
	  usage. Use XX0-9 only, XX0-9 + XXA-F, wrap around to XX0 if
	  last one is too large, etc.
	  ArcMail extensions: mo[0-9], plus mo[a-f], maybe mo[a-z]?
	  runtime configuration of arcmail extensions usage.

	* ftn2rfc: restrict gateway to certain *Internet* addresses.

	* X-Gateway / ^AGATEWAY processing.

	* ftn2rfc: Newsgroups header?

MOSTLY	* ftnpack: better file attach processing, -F DIR option. Don't
DONE.	  copy netmail packets (do_noarc()), use rename(). If archiver
	  fails, move packets back to toss/out directory.

	* Check packet passwords of incoming packets.

	* ftntoss: check # of ^AVia lines

DONE.	* ftntoss: kill old messages (older than 2 weeks?)

OS2	* MSDOS, OS/2 port: switch stdin to binary mode. Command line option?
DONE.	  Problems with news batches (GD030V)?

	* ftn2rfc, rfc2ftn: passthru operation for FTN messages, in
	  particular EchoMail control information.

	* ftntoss: strip ^APATH for ZoneGate

	* ftntoss: ZoneGateFrom as suggested by <slapic@fido.hu>:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
i receive mail from 1:270/101 as 1:270/104 (so i'm 1:270/104)
my normal address is 2:371/2000
i must forward/pack echomail as 2:371/2000
i should strip seen-by and path when forwarding mail from 1:270/101 
regardless whom i'm sending to.

at this moment i have two installed fidogate, one with aka 1:270/104, and 
one with aka 2:371/2000
my 1:270/104 system receives from 1:270/101, and packs for 2:371/2000
2:371/2000 receives from 1:270/104 and processes mail as normal.
and at the end, 2:371/2000 exports to 1:270/101...
it's not so nice... working, but not nice... i'd like to use one system 
on a phisical system.
so if i can do something like this:
ZoneGateFrom    1:270/101       270/101 104 371/2000
ZoneGate        1:270/101       270/101 371/2000
and as the zonegatefrom specifies, fidogate should strip seen-by and path 
every mail _from_ 1:270/101
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	  This requires setting the sender address for the particular
	  area. Something else?
