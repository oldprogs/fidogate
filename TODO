===== TODO list for FIDOGATE development =====================================

=== 4.3aX development snapshots

    Priority 1
    
    Features

	
DONE	* ftnafutil: only process areas with uplink entry in passwd?

	* log.c/config.h: get syslog facility from LogFacility, parse
	  at run-time.

	* rfc2ftn: add config option ForceFMPT0 (pkt_set_forcefmpt0(TRUE))

DONE	* packet.c:pkt_put_msg_hdr(): add run-time configuration for
	  ^AFMPT 0, normally none.

	* ftnafutil: option to sort areas.bbs, including zone/keys.

	* ftn2rfc/rfc2ftn: integrate new charset mapping

	* charset.c: use new mapping tables
	* ^ACHRS default configurable per area + character translation
	  for RFC -> Fido.

	* Different Message-ID and sender Internet domain
	  configuration (extended Zone config).

	* ftn2rfc: ^ARFC-<mime> import.

	* ftn2rfc: send bounce mails directly as FTN messages, not via
	  the mail system.
 	  ftn2rfc: bounce messages should include the complete FTN
	  message with all kludges etc. to ease debugging.

	* ftnpack: runtime configuration of arcmail extension
	  usage. Use XX0-9 only, XX0-9 + XXA-F, wrap around to XX0 if
	  last one is too large, etc.
	  ArcMail extensions: mo[0-9], plus mo[a-f], maybe mo[a-z]?
	  runtime configuration of arcmail extensions usage.

    Code rewrite

	* config.make/subst.pl: configuration macro if syslog is available.



    Priority 2

    Features

	* rfc2ftn: mail split limit configurable per host.

STARTED	* areas.bbs: read-only/vacation flag for downlinks,
	  e.g. Z:N/F.P=flags 
	  ftnaf: commands for vacation flag.

	* ftntoss: check # of ^AVia lines

	* rfc2ftn: option to use node address, not gateway point
	  address for local users.

	* ftn2rfc: process ^ARFC headers. If RFC level 1, import
	  important headers such as Date, Message-ID. If RFC level 2,
	  import all headers present.

    Code rewrite

	* new implementation of strtok(), xstrtok() function, using
	  reentrant common routine.

	* rfcheader.c: rewrite all *header_get* functions using the
	  new rfcheader_geth().

STARTED * Replace calls to strncpy0/strncat0 with str_copy/str_append.

MOSTLY	* ftnpack: better file attach processing, -F DIR option. Don't
DONE	  copy netmail packets (do_noarc()), use rename(). If archiver
	  fails, move packets back to toss/out directory.



    Priority 3

    Features

	* ftn2rfc/rfc2ftn: MAIL-log messages configurable.
	* ftn2rfc/rfc2ftn: mail log + size / message date

	* Generic alias matching: name@Z:N/F.P <-> user@do.main (Name),
	  recipient *and* sender

	* rfc2ftn: improve parser for 1st line. Use regexp library?



=== 4.3bX pre-release

	* ftn2rfc, ftnin: integrate programs.



=== 4.3.X release

	* Update documentation.



===== Later ==================================================================

        * ftntick: charset translation when writing to files.bbs

	* packing: different packing for NetMail/EchoMail

	* packing: MaxArc configurable per node

???	* config.*: common address settings, e.g. Address for main
	  AKA, GateAddress for gateway???

	* Allow config parameters on command line for all programs.

	* Direct mailing list support, gateway EchoMail <-> mailing
	  list.

	* scripts: check that process which created lock file still
	  exists.

	* rfc2ftn: filter function for SPAM.

	* ftntoss: remove duplicate addresses from SEEN-BY
	  (postprocessing for PASSTHRU_ECHOMAIL).

	* ftn2rfc: allow Newsgroups, Followup-To: header.

	* config: run-time configuration for FTN_RFC_HEADERS,
	  RFC_LVL_1_HEADERS, and text headers put into FTN message by
	  rfc2ftn.

	* rfc2ftn: check for multiple entries of the same groups in
	  the Newsgroups header.

	* rfc2ftn: save large mails to file, fattach on hold for
	  recipient?

	* rfc2ftn: configuration option for mail RFC level *per*
	  *host*, e.g. option in HOSTS.

	* ftntick: call script for incoming TICs, passing file area,
	  name, ... for announcements

	* "BestMatchAKA" parameter for all programs. Similar to
	  setting AKA based on current zone, using the AKA with best
	  fits the sender/receiver. For multi-point operation.

	* ftnflo: pipe to program processing the entries (e.g. send
 	  with FTP), new scripts senduu, senduumail.

	* ftntick: remove FILES.BBS entry for old replaced file.

	* ftntick: if node is busy, put necessary data for
	  bink_attach() into separate file, don't wait, retry on the
	  next run.

	* ftnpack: remove 0-size arcmail from previous days.
	
	* ftnroute: new command "xroute" allowing routing based on
	  source *and* destination address.

	* ftnhatch: copy option: copy file to file area and put entry
	  into files.bbs (standard hatch behavior).

	* Check packet passwords of incoming packets.

	* ftntoss: strip ^APATH for ZoneGate

	* ftntoss: ZoneGateFrom as suggested by <slapic@fido.hu>:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
i receive mail from 1:270/101 as 1:270/104 (so i'm 1:270/104)
my normal address is 2:371/2000
i must forward/pack echomail as 2:371/2000
i should strip seen-by and path when forwarding mail from 1:270/101 
regardless whom i'm sending to.

at this moment i have two installed fidogate, one with aka 1:270/104, and 
one with aka 2:371/2000
my 1:270/104 system receives from 1:270/101, and packs for 2:371/2000
2:371/2000 receives from 1:270/104 and processes mail as normal.
and at the end, 2:371/2000 exports to 1:270/101...
it's not so nice... working, but not nice... i'd like to use one system 
on a phisical system.
so if i can do something like this:
ZoneGateFrom    1:270/101       270/101 104 371/2000
ZoneGate        1:270/101       270/101 371/2000
and as the zonegatefrom specifies, fidogate should strip seen-by and path 
every mail _from_ 1:270/101
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	  This requires setting the sender address for the particular
	  area. Something else?
