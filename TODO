X = for release 4.0alpha2

	* ftnpack: lock file for do_dirpack().

	* ftn2rfc: bounce messages should include the complete FTN
	  message with all kludges etc. to ease debugging.

STARTED.* ftntoss: make "send" work as in SQUISH. Needs rewrite of
	  node string parsing functions and routing.c / ftnroute.c.

	* config.h: ALIASES, AREAS, HOSTS, PASSWD, PACKING, ROUTING
	  configurable in config.common

	* kludge.c: handling traversing multiple kludges of the same
	  type.

STARTED.* node.c, routing.c: merge node parsing functions into general
	  ones. parsenode.c

	* ftnpack: runtime configuration of arcmail extension
	  usage. Use XX0-9 only, XX0-9 + XXA-F, wrap around to XX0 if
	  last one is too large, etc.
	  ArcMail extensions: mo[0-9], plus mo[a-f], maybe mo[a-z]?
	  runtime configuration of arcmail extensions usage.

	* Catch SIGINT, process clean-up function.
	  - close all packet files for ftntoss, ftnroute, etc.

	* areas: option -M MAXSIZE, limit maximum RFC message size to
	  MAXSIZE bytes, larger messages won't be gated.

	* areas.bbs: area descriptions, -d "Text ...".

	* ftn2rfc: restrict gateway to certain *Internet* addresses.

	* ftntick: announce new files via mail or news posting.

	* X-Gateway / ^AGATEWAY processing.

	* ftn2rfc: Newsgroups header?

PARTLY	* ftnpack: better file attach processing, -F DIR option. Don't
DONE.	  copy netmail packets (do_noarc()), use rename(). If archiver
	  fails, move packets back to toss/out directory.

rfc2ftn	* Support for new FIDO-Gatebau '94 ^ARFC kludges.
DONE.
	* Check packet passwords of incoming packets.

	* Use rfcaddr.c functions for rfc2ftn mail_sender() etc. and
	  to replace the RFC parsing functions in rfcheader.c

	* MIME support for outgoing RFC messages, especially using the
	  ISO-8859-1 character set (8 bit and MIME quoted printable)
	  for news messages.

	* ftntoss: check # of ^AVia lines

	* ftntoss: kill old messages (older than 2 weeks?)

OS2	* MSDOS, OS/2 port: switch stdin to binary mode. Command line option?
DONE.	  Problems with news batches (GD030V)?

	* ftn2rfc, rfc2ftn: passthru operation for FTN messages, in
	  particular EchoMail control information.
