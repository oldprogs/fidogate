DONE.	* config.h: move most compile-time options to config files.

	* kludge.c: handling traversing multiple kludges of the same
	  type.

	* node.c, routing.c: merge node parsing functions into general
	  ones.

	* ftnpack: runtime configuration of arcmail extension
	  usage. Use XX0-9 only, XX0-9 + XXA-F, wrap around to XX0 if
	  last one is too large, etc.

	* ArcMail extensions: mo[0-9], plus mo[a-f], maybe mo[a-z]?

DONE.	* config.ffx: runtime configuration of compression programs.

DONE.	* ftnroute:do_move(): set file mtime after renaming.

DONE.	* dir.c: function dir_openic(), ignoring case when matching
	  files.

DONE.	* function dir_search(), search file ignoring case, to be
	  used by ftntick, file attachment processing.

DONE.	* ftnroute, ftnpack: use dir_open() to process input
	  directory, set sort order to DIR_SORTMTIME.

	* Catch SIGINT, process clean-up function.
	  - close all packet files for ftntoss, ftnroute, etc.

DONE.	* File attaches, ftnpack, do_noarc(), use flonode!

DONE.	* * Origin -> Organization, config option.

DONE.	  copy netmail packets (do_noarc()), use rename(). If archiver
	  fails, move packets back to toss/out directory.

DONE.	* ftntoss/ftnroute/ftnpack: make -a Z:N/F.P option in
	  AREAS.BBS work. outpkt_open() should take into account
	  packet from addresses as well.

rfc2ftn	* Support for new FIDO-Gatebau '94 ^ARFC kludges.
DONE.
	* Check packet passwords of incoming packets.

	* Use rfcaddr.c functions for rfc2ftn mail_sender() etc. and
	  to replace the RFC parsing functions in rfcheader.c

	* MIME support for outgoing RFC messages, especially using the
	  ISO-8859-1 character set (8 bit and MIME quoted printable)
	  for news messages.

NOT	* Log file of Message-IDs FTN->Usenet
NEEDED.	  Extended log functions

DONE.	* Dupe check for ftntoss using dbm database.
