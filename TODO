	  rfc2ftn.

	* ftn2rfc, rfc2ftn: passthru operation for FTN messages, in
	  particular EchoMail control information.

	* ftntoss: strip ^APATH for ZoneGate

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
i receive mail from 1:270/101 as 1:270/104 (so i'm 1:270/104)
my normal address is 2:371/2000
i must forward/pack echomail as 2:371/2000
i should strip seen-by and path when forwarding mail from 1:270/101 
regardless whom i'm sending to.

at this moment i have two installed fidogate, one with aka 1:270/104, and 
one with aka 2:371/2000
my 1:270/104 system receives from 1:270/101, and packs for 2:371/2000
2:371/2000 receives from 1:270/104 and processes mail as normal.
and at the end, 2:371/2000 exports to 1:270/101...
it's not so nice... working, but not nice... i'd like to use one system 
on a phisical system.
so if i can do something like this:
ZoneGateFrom    1:270/101       270/101 104 371/2000
ZoneGate        1:270/101       270/101 371/2000
and as the zonegatefrom specifies, fidogate should strip seen-by and path 
every mail _from_ 1:270/101
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	  This requires setting the sender address for the particular
	  area. Something else?
