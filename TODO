X = for next release


	* rfc2ftn: save large mails to file, fattach on hold for
	  recipient?

DONE.	* rununpack: support other contents than *.pkt

	* doc: add ftnpack -f --ffx

	* doc: add %L/%S/%G/%O/%I/%P/%U

EXISTS!	* ftnexpire: wait for lock file to be released!

	* ftn2rfc/rfc2ftn: mail log + size / message date

	* doc: add areas -L, LimitMsgSize, #define DO_HAVE_SYSEXITS_H

DONE.	* ftnpack: special option to process ffx control and data
	  files.

	* doc: add RFC header in Fido message body
	  (From, To, Cc, ..., Content-Transfer-Encoding)

	* doc: add X-Flags

DONE.	* ftn2rfc: improve processing of RFC address user%do.main and
	  user@do.main in FTN to field. Avoid "" quotes.

	* rfc2ftn: configuration option for mail RFC level *per*
	  *host*, e.g. option in HOSTS.

	* rfcaddr.c: using quotes for "som(e)thing%special"@host
	  causes problems with news reading. Son-of-rfc1036 saiz that
	  quotes are not allowed in addresses.

STARTED.* DOS/OS2: use \ for path names when running commands via system()
(ftnin)

	* ftntick: call script for incoming TICs, passing file area,
	  name, ...

	* ftnaf: marker in areas.bbs to show if an area is subscribed
	  at the uplink (option or using directory), regularly check
	  if area is subscribed by any downlink and send add/del
	  request to uplink.

	* rfc2ftn: improve parser for 1st line. Use regexp library?

	* rfc2ftn: option to use node address, not gateway point
	  address for local users.

	  setting AKA based on current zone, using the AKA with best
	  fits the sender/receiver. For multi-point operation.

	  processing. Add config parameter for specifying addresses
	  allowed to use X-Flags.

	* ftn2rfc: rewrite, split huge unpack() function into parts
	  for processing netmail and echomail.

	* ftnroute: crashmails to points via boss node.

 	  with FTP), new scripts senduu, senduumail.

	* ftntick: remove FILES.BBS entry for old replaced file.

	* ftntick: if node is busy, put necessary data for

	  into files.bbs (standard hatch behavior).

	* ftn2rfc: bounce messages should include the complete FTN
	  message with all kludges etc. to ease debugging.

	  runtime configuration of arcmail extensions usage.

	* ftn2rfc: restrict gateway to certain *Internet* addresses.

	* X-Gateway / ^AGATEWAY processing.

	* ftn2rfc: Newsgroups header?

MOSTLY	* ftnpack: better file attach processing, -F DIR option. Don't
DONE.	  copy netmail packets (do_noarc()), use rename(). If archiver
	  fails, move packets back to toss/out directory.

	* Check packet passwords of incoming packets.

	* ftntoss: check # of ^AVia lines

	* ftn2rfc, rfc2ftn: passthru operation for FTN messages, in
	  particular EchoMail control information.

	* ftntoss: strip ^APATH for ZoneGate

	* ftntoss: ZoneGateFrom as suggested by <slapic@fido.hu>:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
i receive mail from 1:270/101 as 1:270/104 (so i'm 1:270/104)
my normal address is 2:371/2000
i must forward/pack echomail as 2:371/2000
i should strip seen-by and path when forwarding mail from 1:270/101 
regardless whom i'm sending to.

at this moment i have two installed fidogate, one with aka 1:270/104, and 
one with aka 2:371/2000
my 1:270/104 system receives from 1:270/101, and packs for 2:371/2000
2:371/2000 receives from 1:270/104 and processes mail as normal.
and at the end, 2:371/2000 exports to 1:270/101...
it's not so nice... working, but not nice... i'd like to use one system 
on a phisical system.
so if i can do something like this:
ZoneGateFrom    1:270/101       270/101 104 371/2000
ZoneGate        1:270/101       270/101 371/2000
and as the zonegatefrom specifies, fidogate should strip seen-by and path 
every mail _from_ 1:270/101
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	  This requires setting the sender address for the particular
	  area. Something else?
